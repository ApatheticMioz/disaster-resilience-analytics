        "Depending on the country and year, the data refers either to income (after taxes and benefits) or to consumption, [per capita](#dod:per-capita). For most countries, we have only one option available. But when there is a mix of consumption and income data points, we process the data to keep one observation per country and year.",

      ],
      "descriptionProcessing": "For most countries in the dataset, estimates relate to disposable income or consumption, for all available years. Several countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped to present a single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries. In choosing which data points to keep, we strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies across countries.",
