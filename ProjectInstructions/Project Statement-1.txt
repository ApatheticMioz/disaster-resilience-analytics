To move

beyond reactive response,

global organizations are turning to data intelligence

information to reveal how societies prepare for, absorb, and recover from disasters.

Combine

(E): Frequency and severity of disasters in a region.

(V): Human

and economic losses relative to population or GDP.

(A): Socio-economic and institutional strength for recovery.

You are expected to construct and justify quantitative indices using such relationships.

This metric may represent how disruptive disasters are relative to a country’s wealth and

size.

Data Fusion:

Comparative

Analysis:

Your Tableau dashboard must enable exploration across:

e Time (temporal evolution of resilience)
e Geography

(cross-country or regional comparison)

e Disaster types (earthquake, flood, drought, etc.)
e Socio-economic groups (developed vs developing countries)
R5.

Analytical

Storytelling:

Insights must

emerge

visually.

Your

dashboard

should

help answer questions like:
e Which nations show high exposure but low vulnerability?
e Do wealthier nations recover faster, or does governance matter more?
e How

does resilience evolve alongside climate risk?

Visualization and Design

Requirements

You must independently determine which visualization types best represent your analysis.
Each visual choice should reflect analytical intent, not just aesthetics.
Suggested elements:
e Geo-maps for risk and resilience gradients.
e Time-series plots for resilience evolution.

e Scatter or bubble plots showing relationships (e.g., GDP
e Treemaps

vs. RRS).

or Sankey diagrams to depict flow of impact or aid.

e Interactive filters by region, year, or disaster type.
Your

final dashboard

should

consist

of at least three

Deliverables
1. Interactive Tableau Dashboard:
e Multi-view and interactive with meaningful interrelations.

o Derived metrics and documented formulas.
e Insightful and well-labeled design.

Outcomes

The project must satisify these outcomes:
e Apply data fusion and feature engineering techniques on large public datasets.
e Construct

and reason about computational models using real data.

e Translate analytical insights into effective visualization narratives.
Demonstrate

analytical autonomy

and creative problem-solving.

e Produce professional, interactive dashboards for complex societal phenomena.
