UNIFIED RESILIENCE DATASET - CRITICAL ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================
Generated: December 2, 2025
Analyst: GitHub Copilot (Automated Analysis)
================================================================================

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This report provides a brutally honest assessment of the unified_resilience_dataset.csv
against the project requirements specified in project.txt. The dataset was extracted
from 10 raw data sources using the build_unified_dataset.py script.

VERDICT: THE DATASET HAS SIGNIFICANT GAPS AND LIMITATIONS that will impact your
ability to fully meet project requirements. While usable, several critical issues
need to be addressed or acknowledged.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: PROJECT REQUIREMENTS VS DATASET CAPABILITIES
================================================================================

The project requires you to construct three key indices:

1. DISASTER IMPACT INDEX (DII)
   Formula: DII = ((F + 4A) / GDP_pc) × S
   Where: F = fatalities per million, A = affected population %, 
          GDP_pc = GDP per capita, S = severity weight by disaster type

2. RESILIENCE RECOVERY SCORE (RRS)
   Formula: RRS = [(GDP_growth_post - GDP_growth_pre) + HDI + Gov_index] / (2 × T_recovery)
   
3. COMPOSITE RESILIENCE INDEX (CRI)
   Formula: CRI = A / (E + V)
   Where: A = adaptive capacity, E = exposure, V = vulnerability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENT MAPPING: WHAT'S AVAILABLE VS WHAT'S NEEDED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR DII (Disaster Impact Index):
  ✓ GDP per capita: AVAILABLE (97.8% coverage)
  ✗ Fatalities per million: PARTIALLY AVAILABLE (39.5% coverage from GDACS)
  ✗ Affected population %: PARTIALLY AVAILABLE (GDACS has displaced, not %)
  ✓ Severity weight by disaster type: AVAILABLE (alertscore from GDACS)
  
  PROBLEM: Disaster death/affected data is only 39.5% complete. You cannot 
  reliably calculate DII for most country-years.

FOR RRS (Resilience Recovery Score):
  ✓ GDP growth: AVAILABLE (98.3% coverage)
  ✓ HDI: AVAILABLE (96.1% coverage)
  ✓ Governance index: AVAILABLE (92-94% coverage across WGI indicators)
  ✗ GDP growth before vs after disaster: REQUIRES MANUAL CALCULATION
  ✗ Recovery time (T_recovery): NOT DIRECTLY AVAILABLE - must be computed
  
  PROBLEM: The dataset provides raw GDP growth, but you need to identify 
  disaster years and compute growth differential. This is doable but requires
  additional logic in Tableau or Python.

FOR CRI (Composite Resilience Index):
  ✓ Adaptive capacity: AVAILABLE via ND-GAIN readiness (100% coverage)
  ✓ Exposure: AVAILABLE via ND-GAIN vulnerability + INFORM hazard
  ✓ Vulnerability: AVAILABLE via ND-GAIN vulnerability (97.4%)
  
  STATUS: Best supported of the three indices. CRI can be computed reliably.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT (BRUTAL HONESTY)
================================================================================

CRITICAL ISSUES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. HUMANITARIAN FUNDING (FTS): 96.2% MISSING
   - Only 176 rows have funding data out of 4608 total rows
   - Only 89 countries have any funding data
   - This variable is essentially UNUSABLE for comprehensive analysis
   - IMPACT: Cannot analyze aid flows vs recovery correlation

2. DISASTER DATA COVERAGE: 60.5% MISSING
   - disaster_count: 39.5% coverage
   - disaster_deaths: 39.5% coverage  
   - disaster_displaced: 39.5% coverage
   - red_alerts: 39.5% coverage
   
   PROBLEM: GDACS only provides data for countries that experienced 
   recorded disasters. Countries with NO disasters will show as missing,
   but this is ALSO valuable information (zero events). The script does 
   NOT distinguish between "no data" and "no disasters occurred".
   
   RECOMMENDATION: Countries with no GDACS data should be set to 0 disasters,
   not left as NULL. This is a CRITICAL BUG in the data processing.

3. INFORM RISK INDEX: 67.2% MISSING
   - Data only available from 2016-2024 (source limitation)
   - Years 2000-2015 have 0% coverage
   - This severely limits temporal analysis of risk trends
   
   IMPACT: Cannot show long-term risk evolution pre-2016

4. DESINVENTAR DATA: 73.2% MISSING
   - Only 80 countries have DesInventar data
   - Mostly Latin American, Caribbean, and some Asian countries
   - BIAS: Data is concentrated in certain regions, creating geographic bias

5. GINI INDEX: 61.1% MISSING
   - Inequality data is sparse and irregular
   - Survey-based, not collected annually for all countries
   - IMPACT: Cannot reliably analyze inequality-resilience relationships

6. LITERACY RATE: 81.4% MISSING
   - Education indicator severely incomplete
   - Cannot use as reliable adaptive capacity proxy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MODERATE ISSUES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. HOSPITAL BEDS: 36.0% MISSING
   - Healthcare infrastructure indicator incomplete
   - Affects analysis of health system capacity vs resilience

8. NIGHTTIME LIGHTS: 11.2% MISSING
   - Two different sensors (DMSP 2000-2012, VIIRS 2013-2024)
   - Potential calibration differences between sensors
   - May cause discontinuity in 2013 transition year

9. WGI GOVERNANCE: 6-8% MISSING
   - Very good coverage BUT data is biennial pre-2002
   - WGI uses different methodology for some years

================================================================================
SECTION 3: SPECIFIC PROBLEMS FOR TABLEAU VISUALIZATION
================================================================================

1. INCOMPLETE GEO-MAPS
   - 168/192 countries have disaster data
   - 89/192 countries have funding data
   - 80/192 countries have DesInventar data
   - Maps will have significant "no data" regions appearing blank

2. TIME SERIES DISCONTINUITIES
   - INFORM risk: starts 2016
   - Nighttime lights: sensor change 2013
   - Many indicators have spotty pre-2005 coverage
   - PROBLEM: Cannot create smooth 2000-2024 time series for all variables

3. DISASTER TYPE ANALYSIS
   - GDACS has: Earthquake, Flood, Drought, Forest_Fire, Tropical_Cyclone, Eruption
   - MISSING: Industrial accidents, epidemics/pandemics, technological disasters
   - Project mentions "pandemics and industrial accidents" - NOT IN DATA

4. WEALTH GROUP COMPARISON
   - No pre-built "developed vs developing" classification
   - Must be derived from GDP per capita or other indicators
   - Not a data problem, but requires additional preparation

================================================================================
SECTION 4: WHAT'S MISSING ENTIRELY
================================================================================

The project requirements mention several variables NOT in your dataset:

1. CO2 EMISSIONS - Not extracted (mentioned in project as optional expansion)
2. URBAN DENSITY - Not extracted (mentioned for infrastructure exposure)
3. INFRASTRUCTURE QUALITY INDICES - Not available
4. INSURANCE COVERAGE - Not available
5. EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS DATA - Not available
6. CLIMATE RISK PROJECTIONS - Not available
7. EM-DAT DATA - FILE EXISTS BUT NOT USED!

CRITICAL OVERSIGHT: You have EM-DAT data (public_emdat_incl_hist_2025-12-01.xlsx)
in your Data/emdat folder, but the build script DOES NOT USE IT!

EM-DAT is THE standard disaster database and would provide:
- Comprehensive disaster events
- Total deaths
- Total affected
- Economic damages
- Insurance losses

This is a MAJOR gap that should be fixed.

================================================================================
SECTION 5: DATA SOURCE SUMMARY
================================================================================

DATA SOURCES USED (10 total):
| Source              | Coverage | Quality | Critical for Project? |
|---------------------|----------|---------|----------------------|
| ND-GAIN             | 97.4%    | HIGH    | YES - CRI calculation|
| World Bank WDI      | 97.8%    | HIGH    | YES - economic base  |
| IMF WEO             | 97.3%    | HIGH    | YES - GDP growth     |
| HDR                 | 96.1%    | HIGH    | YES - HDI for RRS    |
| WGI                 | 92-94%   | HIGH    | YES - governance     |
| Nighttime Lights    | 88.8%    | MEDIUM  | OPTIONAL             |
| GDACS               | 39.5%    | MEDIUM  | YES - disaster events|
| INFORM Risk         | 32.8%    | HIGH    | YES but limited years|
| DesInventar         | 26.8%    | LOW     | OPTIONAL - bias risk |
| FTS Funding         | 3.8%     | LOW     | NO - too sparse      |

DATA SOURCE NOT USED BUT AVAILABLE:
- EM-DAT (critical disaster database - SHOULD BE ADDED)

================================================================================
SECTION 6: SPECIFIC BUGS/ISSUES IN DATA PROCESSING
================================================================================

1. ZERO vs NULL for Disasters
   The script merges GDACS data with left join, leaving countries without
   disasters as NULL. These should be 0 (no disasters recorded), not missing.
   
   FIX: Add fillna(0) for disaster_count, red_alerts after merge

2. EM-DAT Not Integrated
   EM-DAT file exists but script doesn't process it. This is comprehensive
   disaster data that would greatly improve disaster coverage.
   
   FIX: Add EM-DAT processing section to build script

3. Year Range Mismatch
   Script targets 2000-2024, but data only goes to 2023 (per validation report)
   2024 is likely too recent for most sources.
   
   MINOR: Adjust YEAR_END to 2023

4. DesInventar Country Mapping
   Several country codes are non-standard:
   - AR2 (mapped to ARM - Armenia)
   - LAO2 (mapped to LAO - Laos)
   - NG_OY (mapped to NGA - Nigeria)
   Some mappings may be incorrect or data may be duplicated.

5. Nighttime Lights Calibration
   DMSP and VIIRS have different measurement scales. No inter-calibration
   is performed, which may cause artificial trend breaks in 2013.

================================================================================
SECTION 7: RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

MUST DO (Critical for Project Success):
---------------------------------------
1. ADD EM-DAT DATA
   - Process the existing emdat file
   - Will dramatically improve disaster coverage
   - Provides economic damage data (useful for DII)

2. FIX DISASTER NULL VALUES
   - Countries with no GDACS disasters should have 0, not NULL
   - This affects 60% of your data interpretation

3. ACKNOWLEDGE TEMPORAL GAPS
   - INFORM only 2016+: state this limitation clearly in report
   - Be honest about what years can be reliably analyzed

SHOULD DO (Improves Analysis):
------------------------------
4. ADD CO2 EMISSIONS
   - World Bank has this data (WDI indicator EN.ATM.CO2E.KT)
   - Project explicitly mentions this as an expansion option

5. ADD URBAN POPULATION
   - WDI has urbanization rates
   - Useful for infrastructure exposure calculations

6. CREATE INCOME GROUPS
   - Add World Bank income classification
   - Enables "developed vs developing" comparison required by project

NICE TO HAVE (If Time Permits):
-------------------------------
7. INTERPOLATE GINI
   - Forward/backward fill within countries
   - Currently 39% coverage could become ~70%

8. CROSS-VALIDATE DISASTER SOURCES
   - Compare GDACS, DesInventar, and EM-DAT where overlap exists
   - Identify and resolve discrepancies

================================================================================
SECTION 8: CAN YOU MEET PROJECT REQUIREMENTS?
================================================================================

HONEST ASSESSMENT:

1. "Integrate at least three open datasets" 
   ✓ YES - You have 10 sources integrated

2. "Align datasets on country-year pairs"
   ✓ YES - Primary key is (iso3, year)

3. "Handle missing values analytically"
   ⚠ PARTIAL - Missing values exist but no imputation strategy documented

4. "Feature Engineering: Derive variables"
   ⚠ PARTIAL - Some derived but missing key variables:
   - Annualized disaster frequency: Available
   - Economic loss per event normalized by GDP: NOT AVAILABLE (need economic damages)
   - Recovery rate based on GDP rebound: Calculable but not pre-computed
   - Human cost ratio: Available but 60% missing

5. "Model Formulation: Implement DII, RRS, CRI"
   ⚠ PARTIAL
   - CRI: Can be calculated reliably
   - DII: Limited by disaster data coverage
   - RRS: Requires additional computation for recovery periods

6. "Comparative Analysis: Time, Geography, Disaster Types, Socio-economic groups"
   ⚠ PARTIAL
   - Time: Limited pre-2016 for some variables
   - Geography: 192 countries available
   - Disaster types: 6 types available
   - Socio-economic groups: Need to derive income classifications

7. "Three analytical views in Tableau"
   ✓ YES - Dataset supports multiple views

================================================================================
SECTION 9: FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: 6.5/10 - USABLE WITH SIGNIFICANT CAVEATS

The dataset is USABLE but NOT IDEAL for the project. You can:
- Calculate CRI reliably
- Show geographic comparisons
- Analyze governance vs resilience
- Display disaster patterns (for ~40% of data)

You CANNOT reliably:
- Calculate DII for most countries (missing death/affected data)
- Show pre-2016 risk trends (INFORM limitation)
- Analyze humanitarian aid flows (3.8% coverage)
- Include pandemic/industrial disaster analysis

CRITICAL ACTIONS BEFORE SUBMISSION:
1. ADD EM-DAT DATA - This is your most important fix
2. Document all limitations in your report
3. Be transparent about what your visualizations can and cannot show
4. Focus on CRI and governance analysis where data is strongest

The project statement says "GDHRA provides no fixed formulas... It is your job
to define what resilience means computationally." This gives you flexibility
to work around data limitations by focusing on well-supported metrics.
