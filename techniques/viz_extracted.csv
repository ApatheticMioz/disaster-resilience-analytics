ID,Title,Abstract
1,HierarchyMap: A Novel Approach to Treemap Visualization of Hierarchical Data,"The HierarchyMap describes a novel approach for Treemap Visualization method for representing large volume of hierarchical information on a 2-dimensional space. HierarchyMap algorithm is a new ordered treemap algorithm. Results of the implementation of HierarchyMap treemap algorithm show that it is capable of representing several thousands of hierarchical data on 2-dimensional space on a computer and Portable Device Application (PDA) screens while still maintaining the qualities found in existing treemap algorithms such as readability, low aspect ratio, reduced run time, and reduced number of thin rectangles. The HierarchyMap treemap algorithm is implemented in Java programming language and tested with dataset of Departmental and Faculty systems of Universities, Family trees, Plant and Animal taxonomy structures."
2,Trevis: A context tree visualization and analysis framework and its use for classifying performance failure reports,"When developers profile their applications to identify performance problems, they normally use profilers producing calling context trees. A calling context tree (CCT) represents the caller-callee relationships of a program. A dynamically collected CCT provides method coverage information. The CCTs produced by profilers also include method hotness information. Trevis, our context tree visualization and analysis framework, allows users to visualize, compare, cluster, and intersect CCTs produced by profilers. We evaluate Trevis in the context of a novel profiling tool called FlyBy. FlyBy runs transparently on an end-user's computer and continuously samples the applications' call stack. When the user perceives the application as sluggish, she presses a ""Was Slow!"" button to tell FlyBy to file a performance failure report. The report contains the CCT based on the call stack samples FlyBy gathered over the last few seconds before the user pressed the button. We show how Trevis allows us to visualize and classify FlyBy bug reports."
3,Navigation techniques for 2.5D graph layout,"In this paper, we consider the problem of navigating graphs drawn in 2.5 dimensions. First, we define criteria for good navigation and then present various methods to satisfy some of the criteria. In particular, we design and implement methods for trees, clustered graphs and hierarchical graphs drawn in 2.5 dimensions."
4,Efficient planar embedding of trees for VLSI layouts,"The use of planar polygonal partitioning schemes for planar embedding of tree structures is examined. Two layout designs based on recursive square and triangular decompositions are described for trees having branching factors of k*k and k*k-1, where k is an integer. The former design allocates the same amount of area to nodes at all levels and requires a total area linear in the number N of nodes in the tree. The latter design assigns increasing area to nodes closer to the root and requires a total area of O[N(k*k/(k*k-1))logN]. The longest interconnection has a length of O(sqrt(Area(N))) in each case."
5,The hype over Hyperbolic Browsers,"Considers complaints about the usability in the human-computer interaction aspect of information retrieval and discusses information visualization, the Online Library of Information Visualization Environments, hyperbolic information structure, subject searching, real-world applications, relational databases and hyperbolic trees, and the future of visual information structures."
6,Information Pyramidstexttrademark: A New Approach to Visualising Large Hierarchies,"This paper presents work in progress on a new technique for visualising and manipulating large hierarchies. The Information Pyramids approach compactly visualises hierarchical structures in three dimensions using pyramid-like structures, which grow upwards as the hierarchy is descended. The technique is described in the context of our early experience with a prototype file system visualiser based on Information Pyramids."
7,"Information Slices: Visualising and Exploring Large Hierarchies using Cascading, Semi-Circular Discs",This paper presents work in progress on a new technique for visualising and manipulating large hierarchies. The information slices approach compactly visualises hierarchical structures using a series of semi-circular discs. The technique is described in the context of our early experience with a prototype file system visualiser based on information slices.
8,The InfoSky visual explorer: Exploiting hierarchical structure and document similarities,"InfoSky is a system enabling users to explore large, hierarchically structured document collections. Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. Documents of similar content are placed close to each other and are visualised as stars, forming clusters with distinct shapes. For greater performance, the hierarchical structure is exploited and force-directed placement is applied recursively at each level on much fewer objects, rather than on the whole corpus. Collections of documents at a particular level in the hierarchy are visualised with bounding polygons using a modified weighted Voronoi diagram. Their area is related to the number of documents contained. Textual labels are displayed dynamically during navigation, adjusting to the visualisation content. Navigation is animated and provides a seamless zooming transition between summary and detail view. Users can map metadata such as document size or age to attributes of the visualisation such as colour and luminance. Queries can be made and matching documents or collections are highlighted. Formative usability testing is ongoing; a small baseline experiment comparing the telescope browser to a tree browser is discussed."
9,Visual Exploration of Large Hierarchies with Information Pyramids,"Information pyramids compactly visualise large hierarchical structures in three dimensions using pyramid-like structures, which grow upwards as the hierarchy deepens. A plateau represents the root of the tree; other, smaller plateaus arranged on top of it represent its subtrees. Separate glyphs are used to represent leaf nodes such as files or documents and navigational facilities are provided for interactive exploration. Two generations of information pyramids prototype are described and discussed."
10,Visualising Large Hierarchically Structured Document Repositories with InfoSky,"InfoSky is an interactive system for the exploration of large, hierarchically structured document collections. InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification like a real-world telescope. The hierarchical structure is reflected using recursive subdivision into Voronoi polygons. At each level of the hierarchy documents and subcollections are positioned according to the similarity of their content using a force-directed placement technique. Documents are assumed to have significant textual content, which can be extracted with specialised tools. The hierarchical structure is exploited for greater performance. Force-directed placement is applied recursively at each level on the objects at that level rather than on the whole corpus."
11,The visualisation of large hierarchical document spaces with InfoSky,"It is no longer unusual for large document collections to contain many millions of documents. In order to manage this size of repository, it is often essential to structure the repository according to a thematic classification hierarchy. InfoSky is a system enabling users to explore such large, hierarchically structured document collections. Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. The hierarchical structure is represented by recursive Voronoi subdivision of the available space. At each level, larger subcollections are assigned more space and related subcollections gravitate towards one another. Individual documents at each level of the hierarchy are represented by stars placed according to their similarity. Finally, InfoSky extracts and displays descriptors describing the essential theme of each subcollection at each level of the hierarchy."
12,ControlTree: Navigating and Selecting in a Large Tree,"We introduce ControlTree, a novel interface using crossing interaction to navigate and select nodes in a large tree. ControlTree combines an optimized dynamic layout with interaction features to quickly reach a node in a node-link tree representation."
13,Naviguer dans des grands arbres avec ControlTree,"This article presents ControlTree, a relevant technique to select a node is a very large node-link representation using a continuous interaction. The node-link representation is dynamic and driven by the cursor location to optimize screen space and to ease the selections. ControlTree uses a snapping mechanism and adapts the OrthoZoom technique to offer an alternative to common ""point-and-click"" techniques. We also present a preliminary theoretical evaluation showing that ControlTree is a promising technique."
14,Method and system for generating a Columnar Tree Map,"A method and system to generate a columnar tree map of a hierarchical structure is provided. An example system comprises a memory, at least one processor coupled to the memory, a data access module configured to access a hierarchical data structure, and a tree map generator to generate a tree map using at least one processor. The tree map generator generates and renders a tree map for a target data set based on the size and dimensions of a viewing area provided on a target display device, the values associated with categories in the data set, and a predetermined column width."
15,Navigable visualization of a hierarchical data structure,"An example system generates, for a target data set, a navigable space based upon quantitatively-visualized menus. The navigable space is provided within a viewing area on a display device and comprises a stacked bar chart at the left end of a viewing area and, on the right end of the viewing area, a bar graph comprising set of bars. The stacked bar chart is also usable as an actionable menu."
16,GosperMap: Using a Gosper curve for laying out hierarchical data,"The emergence of very large hierarchies that result from the increase in available data raises many problems of visualization and navigation. On data sets of such scale, classical graph drawing methods do not take advantage of certain human cognitive skills such as shape recognition. These cognitive skills could make it easier to remember the global structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a method that is based on the use of nested irregular shapes. We name it GosperMap as we rely on the use of a Gosper Curve to generate these shapes. By employing human perception mechanisms that were developed by handling, for example, cartographic maps, this technique facilitates the visualization and navigation of a hierarchy. An algorithm has been designed to preserve region containment according to the hierarchy and to set the leaves' sizes proportionally to a property, in such a way that the size of nonleaf regions corresponds to the sum of their children's sizes. Moreover, the input ordering of the hierarchy's nodes is preserved, i.e., the areas that represent two consecutive children of a node in the hierarchy are adjacent to one another. This property is especially useful because it guarantees some stability in our algorithm. We illustrate our technique by providing visualization examples of the repartition of tax money in the US over time. Furthermore, we validate the use of the GosperMap in a professional documentation context and show the stability and ease of memorization for this type of map."
17,Visualizing the structure of large trees,"This study introduces a new method of visualizing complex tree structured objects. The usefulness of this method is illustrated in the context of detecting unexpected features in a data set of very large trees. The major contribution is a novel two-dimensional graphical representation of each tree, with a covariate coded by color. The motivating data set contains three dimensional representations of brain artery systems of 105 subjects. Due to inaccuracies inherent in the medical imaging techniques, issues with the reconstruction algo- rithms and inconsistencies introduced by manual adjustment, various discrepancies are present in the data. The proposed representation enables quick visual detection of the most common discrepancies. For our driving example, this tool led to the modification of 10% of the artery trees and deletion of 6.7%. The benefits of our cleaning method are demonstrated through a statistical hypothesis test on the effects of aging on vessel structure. The data cleaning resulted in improved significance levels."

19,Drawing Phylogenetic Trees,"We present linear-time algorithms for drawing phylogenetic trees in radial and circular representations. In radial drawings given edge lengths (representing evolutionary distances) are preserved, but labels (names of taxons represented in the leaves) need to be adjusted, whereas in circular drawings labels are perfectly spread out, but edge lengths adjusted. Our algorithms produce drawings that are unique solutions to reasonable criteria and assign to each subtree a wedge of its own. The linear running time is particularly interesting in the circular case, because our approach is a special case of Tutte's barycentric layout algorithm involving the solution of a system of linear equations."
20,Tree Drawings on the Hexagonal Grid,"We consider straight-line drawings of trees on a hexagonal grid. The hexagonal grid is an extension of the common grid with inner nodes of degree six. We restrict the number of directions used for the edges from each node to its children from one to five, and to five patterns: straight, Y, psi, X, and full. The psi-drawings generalize hv- or strictly upward drawings to ternary trees. We show that complete ternary trees have a psi-drawing on a square of size and general ternary trees can be drawn within area. Both bounds are optimal. Sub-quadratic bounds are also obtained for X-pattern drawings of complete tetra trees, and for full-pattern drawings of complete penta trees, which are 4-ary and 5-ary trees. These results parallel and complement the ones of Frati for straight-line orthogonal drawings of ternary trees. Moreover, we provide an algorithm for compacted straight-line drawings of penta trees on the hexagonal grid, such that the direction of the edges from a node to its children is given by our patterns and these edges have the same length. However, drawing trees on a hexagonal grid within a prescribed area or with unit length edges is NP-hard."
21,How to draw free trees inside bounded simple polygons,"In this paper we investigate polyline grid drawing of free trees on 2D grids which are bounded by simple polygons. We focus on achieving uniform node distribution while we also try to achieve minimum edge crossings. We do not consider achieving symmetry as a mandatory task, but our algorithm can exploit some symmetries present in both the given trees and the given polygons. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt for developing algorithms that draw graphs on regions which are bounded by simple polygons."
22,Space-filling Software Visualization,"SeeSys is a system embodying a technique for visualizing statistics associated with code that is divided hierarchically into subsystems, directories and files. This technique can display the relative sizes of the components in the system, the relative stability of the components, the location of new functionality and the location of error-prone code with many bug fixes. Using animation, it can display the historical evolution of the code. Applying this technique, the source code from a multi-million line production software product is visualized."
23,Hierarchy based 3D Visualization of Large Software Structures,Modern object-oriented programs are hierarchical systems with many thousands of interrelated subsystems. Visualization helps developers to better comprehend these large and complex systems. This work presents a three-dimensional visualization technique that represents the static structure of object-oriented software using distributions of three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane. The visual complexity is reduced by adjusting the transparency of object surfaces to the distance of the viewpoint. An approach called Hierarchical Net is proposed for a clear representation of the relationships between the subsystems.
24,Voronoi Treemaps,"Treemaps are a well known method for the visualization of attributed hierarchical data. Previously proposed treemap layout algorithms are limited to rectangular shapes, which cause problems with the aspect ratio of the rectangles as well as with identifying the visualized hierarchical structure. The approach of Voronoi treemaps presented in this paper eliminates these problems through enabling subdivisions of and in polygons. Additionally, this allows for creating treemap visualizations within areas of arbitrary shape, such as triangles and circles, thereby enabling a more flexible adaptation of treemaps for a wider range of applications."
25,PygmyBrowse: A small screen tree browser,"We present PygmyBrowse, a browser that allows users to navigate a tree data structure in a limited amount of display space. A pilot evaluation of PygmyBrowse was conducted, and results suggest that it reduces task completion times and increases user satisfaction over two alternative node-link tree browsers."
26,"A Note on the Historical Development of Logic Diagrams: Leibniz, Euler and Venn",
27,"A generic algorithm for sequential, rectangular, space filling layouts","We present a generic algorithm to sequentially pave a rectangular area with smaller, fixed-surface, rectangles. The parameters of this algorithm are functional, and it covers the full design space considered. This class of layouts is interesting, because it includes all kinds of treemaps involving the placement of rectangles. For instance, Slice and dice, Squarified, Strip and Pivot layouts are obtained through various formulations of two simple chunking and phrasing functions. Some new and potentially interesting layouts which can be generated using our algorithm are introduced, such as spiral treemaps and data dependent variations of known layout strategies."
28,Capturing the Design Space of Sequential Space-Filling Layouts,"We characterize the design space of the algorithms that sequentially tile a rectangular area with smaller, fixed-surface, rectangles. This space consist of five independent dimensions: Order, Size, Score, Recurse and Phrase. Each of these dimensions describe a particular aspect of such layout tasks. This class of layouts is interesting, because, beyond encompassing simple grids, tables and trees, it also includes all kinds of treemaps involving the placement of rectangles. For instance, Slice and dice, Squarified, Strip and Pivot layouts are various points in this five dimensional space. Many classic statistics visualizations, such as 100% stacked bar charts, mosaic plots and dimensional stacking, are also instances of this class. A few new and potentially interesting points in this space are introduced, such as spiral treemaps and variations on the strip layout. The core algorithm is implemented as a JavaScript prototype that can be used as a layout component in a variety of InfoViz toolkits."
29,Cheops: A Compact Explorer For Complex Hierarchies,"As the amount of electronic information explodes, hierarchies to handle this information become huge and complex. Visualizing and interacting with these hierarchies become daunting tasks. The problem is exacerbated if the visualization is to be done on massmarket personal computers, with limited processing power and visual resolution. Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for hierarchies of 1000 nodes. But as the number of nodes increases toward 5000 nodes, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above 5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering, which can affect visual stability. This paper introduces Cheops, a novel approach to the representation, browsing and exploration of huge, complex information hierarchies such as the Dewey Decimal system, which can contain between 1 million and 1 billion nodes. The Cheops approach maintains context within a huge hierarchy, while simultaneously providing easy access to details. This paper will also present some preliminary results from usability tests performed on an 8 wide by 9 deep classification hierarchy, which if fully populated would contain over 19 million nodes."
30,Generalized Pythagoras Trees for Visualizing Hierarchies,"Pythagoras Trees are fractals that can be used to depict binary hierarchies. But this binary encoding is an obstacle for visualizing hierarchical data such as file systems or phylogenetic trees, which branch into n subhierarchies. Although any hierarchy can be modeled as a binary one by subsequently dividing n-ary branches into a sequence of n-1 binary branches, we follow a different strategy. In our approach extending Pythagoras Trees to arbitrarily branching trees, we only need a single visual element for an n-ary branch instead of spreading the binary branches along a strand. Each vertex in the hierarchy is visualized as a rectangle sized according to a metric. We analyze several visual parameters such as length, width, order, and color of the nodes against the use of different metrics. The usefulness of our technique is illustrated by two case studies visualizing directory structures and a large phylogenetic tree. We compare our approach with existing tree diagrams and discuss questions of geometry, perception, readability, and aesthetics."
31,Generalized Pythagoras Trees: A fractal approach to hierarchy visualization,"Through their recursive definition, many fractals have an inherent hierarchical structure. An example are binary branching Pythagoras Trees. By stopping the recursion in certain branches, a binary hierarchy can be encoded and visualized. But this binary encoding is an obstacle for representing general hierarchical data such as file systems or phylogenetic trees, which usually branch into more than two subhierarchies. We hence extend Pythagoras Trees to arbitrarily branching trees by adapting the geometry of the original fractal approach. Each vertex in the hierarchy is visualized as a rectangle sized according to a metric. We analyze several visual parameters such as length, width, order, and color of the nodes against the use of different metrics. Interactions help to zoom, browse, and filter the hierarchy. The usefulness of our technique is illustrated by two case studies visualizing directory structures and a large phylogenetic tree. We compare our approach with existing tree diagrams and discuss questions of geometry, perception, readability, and aesthetics."
32,PhotoMesa: A Zoomable Image Browser Using Quantum Treemaps and Bubblemaps,"PhotoMesa is a zoomable image browser that uses a novel treemap algorithm to present large numbers of images grouped by directory, or other available metadata. It uses a new interaction technique for zoomable user interfaces designed for novices and family use that makes it straightforward to navigate through the space of images, and impossible to get lost. PhotoMesa groups images using one of two new algorithms that lay out groups of objects in a 2D space-filling manner. Quantum treemaps are designed for laying out images or other objects of indivisible (quantum) size. They are a variation on existing treemap algorithms in that they guarantee that every generated rectangle will have a width and height that are an integral multiple of an input object size. Bubblemaps also fill space with groups of quantum-sized objects, but generate non-rectangular blobs, and utilize space more efficiently."
33,Ordered and quantum treemaps: Making effective use of 2D space to display hierarchies,"Treemaps, a space-filling method for visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms have been previously proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, fail to preserve order of the underlying data, and create layouts that are difficult to visually search. In addition, continuous treemap algorithms are not suitable for displaying fixed-sized objects within them, such as images.This paper introduces a new ""strip"" treemap algorithm which addresses these shortcomings, and analyzes other ""pivot"" algorithms we recently developed showing the trade-offs between them. These ordered treemap algorithms ensure that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials and from actual stock market data, we show that, compared to other layout algorithms, ordered treemaps are more stable, while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A user study with 20 participants clarifies the human performance benefits of the new algorithms. Finally, we present quantum treemap algorithms, which modify the layout of the continuous treemap algorithms to generate rectangles that are integral multiples of an input object size. The quantum treemap algorithm has been applied to PhotoMesa, an application that supports browsing of large numbers of images."
34,"Scalable, Robust Visualization of Very Large Trees","The TreeJuxtaposer system allowed visual comparison of large trees with guaranteed visibility of landmarks and Focus+Context navigation. While that system allowed exploration and comparison of larger datasets than previous work, it was limited to a single tree of 775,000 nodes by a large memory footprint. In this paper, we describe the theoretical limitations to TreeJuxtaposer's architecture that severely restrict its scalability. We provide two scalable, robust solutions to these limitations: TJC and TJC-Q. TJC is a system that supports browsing trees up to 15 million nodes by exploiting leading-edge graphics hardware while TJC-Q allows browsing trees up to 5 million nodes on commodity platforms. Both of these systems use a fast new algorithm for drawing and culling and benefit from a complete redesign of all data structures for more efficient memory usage and reduced preprocessing time."
35,Three-dimensional embedding of binary trees,"We describe total congestion 1 embeddings of complete binary trees into three dimensional grids with expansion ratios 1.172 and 1.25. That is, we give a one-to-one embedding of any complete binary tree into a hexahedron shaped grid such that: the number of nodes in the grid is at most 1.172 (1.25) times the number of nodes in the tree; and no tree nodes or edges occupy the same grid positions. The first strategy embeds trees into cube shaped 3D grids. That is, 3D grids in which all dimensions are roughly equal in size. The second strategy embeds trees into flat 3D grid shapes. That is, it maps complete binary trees into 3D grids with a fixed, small number of layers. An application suggests which embedding to use. For simulations in parallel computer environments, or possibly graph drawing, a cube shaped 3D grid is appropriate. For the sake of VLSI, or other graph drawing applications, embeddings with a small number of layers are better."
36,Embedding a complete binary tree into a three-dimensional grid,"We describe total congestion 1 embeddings of complete binary trees into three dimensional grids with low expansion ratio r. That is, we give a one-to-one embedding of any complete binary tree into a hexahedron shaped grid such that (a) the number of nodes in the grid is at most r times the number of nodes in the tree, and (b) no tree nodes or edges occupy the same grid positions. The first strategy embeds trees into cube shaped 3D grids. That is, 3D grids in which all dimensions are roughly equal in size, and which thus have no limit in the number of layers. The technique uses a recursive scheme, and we obtain an expansion ratio of r=1.09375. We then give strategies which embed trees into flat 3D grid shapes. That is, we map complete binary trees into 3D grids with a fixed, small number of layers k. Using again a recursive scheme, for k=2, we obtain r=1.25. By a rather different technique, which intricately weaves the branches of various subtrees into each other, we are able to obtain very tight embeddings: We have r=1.171875 for embeddings into five layer grids and r=1.09375 for embeddings into seven layer grids."
37,Using Orthographic Projection and Animation to Convey Treemap Structure,"We present an alternative treemap visualization method that maintains the space-filling and area comparison benefits of the standard treemap while improving the range of possible comparisons and the clarity of the hierarchy. Our visualization uses an orthographic stack representation and relies on interaction and animation to reveal the structure of the treemap to the user, but is still effective in a static environment once the user reaches a view that interests them."
38,Method and apparatus for the viewing and exploration of the content of hierarchical information,"A method and system are disclosed for displaying a graphical representation on a display screen of a data processing system in a manner that optimizes screen ""real estate"" and ease of information viewing. The graphical representation may be a tree hierarchy including a plurality of expandable and collapsible nodes. The method begins as the hierarchy is displayed within a primary display window on the display screen when the user selects a node to be expanded . In response, a first display region is output within the primary display window and includes a set of one or more subnodes associated with the selected node. If a first subnode in the first display region is then selected for expansion, a second display region is then output within the first display region, and the second display region in turn includes a set of one or more subnodes of the first subnode. This generation of new ""nested"" display regions then continues as the user continues to explore deeper into the tree hierarchy. A given subnode display region may have one or more controls, such as a sizing button or one or more scroll bars, to facilitate display of node information within the region, and preferably each expanded node remains associated with its subnode display region using a guideline. If generation and display of a subnode display region requires additional screen space, one or more of the subnodes in the ""parent"" display region are re-positioned."
39,Treemaps with Bounded Aspect Ratio,"Treemaps are a popular technique to visualize hierarchical data. The input is a weighted tree T where the weight of each node is the sum of the weights of its children. A treemap for T is a hierarchical partition of a rectangle into simply connected regions, usually rectangles. Each region represents a node of T and its area is proportional to the weight of the corresponding node. An important quality criterion for treemaps is the aspect ratio of its regions. One cannot bound the aspect ratio if the regions are restricted to be rectangles. In contrast, polygonal partitions, that use convex polygons, can have bounded aspect ratio. We are the first to obtain convex partitions with optimal aspect ratio O(depth(T)) . However, depth(T) still depends on the input tree. Hence we introduce a new type of treemaps, namely orthoconvex treemaps, where regions representing leaves are rectangles, L-, and S-shapes, and regions representing internal nodes are orthoconvex polygons. We prove that any input tree, irrespective of the weights of the nodes and the depth of the tree, admits an orthoconvex treemap of constant aspect ratio."
40,Treemaps with Bounded Aspect Ratio,"Treemaps are a popular technique to visualize hierarchical data. The input is a weighted tree $tree$ where the weight of each node is the sum of the weights of its children. A treemap for $tree$ is a hierarchical partition of a rectangle into simply connected regions, usually rectangles. Each region represents a node of $tree$ and the area of each region is proportional to the weight of the corresponding node. An important quality criterium for treemaps is the aspect ratio of its regions. Unfortunately, one cannot bound the aspect ratio if the regions are restricted to be rectangles. Hence Onak and Sidiropoulos in SoCG 2008 introduced polygonal partitions, which use convex polygons. We are the first to obtain convex partitions with optimal aspect ratio $O(depth(tree))$. Furthermore, we consider rectilinear partitions, which retain more of the schematized flavor of standard rectangular treemaps. Our rectilinear treemaps have constant aspect ratio, independent of $depth(tree)$ or the number and weight of the nodes. The leaves of $tree$ are represented by rectangles, L-, and S-shapes and internal nodes by orthoconvex polygons. We also consider the important special case that $depth(tree)=1$, that is, single-level treemaps. We prove that it is strongly NP-hard to minimize the aspect ratio of a rectangular single-level treemap. On the positive side we show how to construct rectilinear and convex single-level treemaps with constant aspect ratio. Our rectilinear single-level treemaps use only rectangles and L-shapes and have aspect ratio at most $2 + 2 3/3$. The convex version uses four different octilinear shapes and has aspect ratio at most 9/2."
41,Convex Treemaps with Bounded Aspect Ratio,"Treemaps are a popular technique to visualize hierarchical data. The input is a weighted tree T where the weight of each node is the sum of the weights of its children. A treemap for T is a hierarchical partition of a rectangle into simply connected regions, usually rectangles. Each region represents a node of T and the area of each region is proportional to the weight of the corresponding node. An important quality criterium for treemaps is the aspect ratio of its regions. Unfortunately, one cannot bound the aspect ratio if the regions are restricted to be rectangles. Hence Onak and Sidiropoulos introduced polygonal partitions, which use convex polygons. We are the first to obtain convex partitions with optimal aspect ratio O(depth(T)). We also consider the important special case that depth(T)=1, that is, single-level treemaps. We show how to construct convex single-level treemaps that use only four simple shapes for the regions and have aspect ratio at most 34/7."
42,Fat Polygonal Partitions with Applications to Visualization and Embeddings,"Let T be a rooted and weighted tree, where the weight of any node is equal to the sum of the weights of its children. The popular Treemap algorithm visualizes such a tree as a hierarchical partition of a square into rectangles, where the area of the rectangle corresponding to any node in T is equal to the weight of that node. The aspect ratio of the rectangles in such a rectangular partition necessarily depends on the weights and can become arbitrarily high. We introduce a new hierarchical partition scheme, called a polygonal partition, which uses convex polygons rather than just rectangles. We present two methods for constructing polygonal partitions, both having guarantees on the worst-case aspect ratio of the constructed polygons; in particular, both methods guarantee a bound on the aspect ratio that is independent of the weights of the nodes. We also consider rectangular partitions with slack, where the areas of the rectangles may differ slightly from the weights of the corresponding nodes. We show that this makes it possible to obtain partitions with constant aspect ratio. This result generalizes to hyper-rectangular partitions in $R^d$. We use these partitions with slack for embedding ultrametrics into d-dimensional Euclidean space: we give a polylog(delta)-approximation algorithm for embedding n-point ultrametrics into $R^d$ with minimum distortion, where delta denotes the spread of the metric. The previously best-known approximation ratio for this problem was polynomial in n. This is the first algorithm for embedding a non-trivial family of weighted-graph metrics into a space of constant dimension that achieves polylogarithmic approximation ratio."
43,Visualizing Gene Expression Data via Voronoi Treemaps,We investigate the use of Voronoi Treemaps to visualize complex biological data from gene expression analysis in conjunction with hierarchical classifications like Gene Ontology or KEGG Orthology.
44,xps -- Dynamic Process Tree Watching Under X,"The xps program dynamically displays the Unix processes as a tree or forest in an X Window, the roots on the left and the leaf processes (those with no children) on the right. The status of each process running, sleeping, stopped, etc., can be indicated by different colors. Different users can appear as different colors too. Process selection can be made per user, all users, or through a regular-expression pattern. In contrast to the terminal-based pstree or tree-widget based programs, the tree display uses diagonal lines, and effort is made to effectively use the full 2-dimensional area of the screen by balancing levels and centering the children of a node between their parent. A goal of the program is to give an idea of what's going on graphically as things may be constantly changing. Therefore the display algorithm tries to keep processes close to their parents to reduce the amount of scrolling to see localized process creation and destruction. Some effort is also given to make sure that the tree layout doesn't get wildly reorganized when there are small or localized changes. This makes it easier for the eye to pick up and recognize the changes over a potentially large display area. We describe here criteria for tree animations such as this one and how the xps layout algorithm works. There are some other miscellaneous features of xps. One can select viewing the processes by a single user, a regular expression for users, by all users, and perhaps show kernel processes. One can click on a process to get more information (via ps or a user-specified program) about that process, send a signal, or set the process priority, assuming you have the permission to do so. Since programs of this ilk can consume a bit of CPU on their own, some effort has been made to turn off the update process when the program is iconified or not visible for some other reason such as being obscured by another window. Some attention has been paid to make algorithm display fairly fast in most situations, although it has to be admitted that this comes sometimes at the expense of a nicer layout."
45,"Semiologie graphique. Les diagrammes, les reseaux, les cartes","Jacques Bertin a joue un role majeur dans l'evolution des conceptions graphiques et cartographiques. Semiologie graphique est l'un de ses ouvrages incontournables, plusieurs fois reedite et traduit en anglais. Cette nouvelle edition propose une carte hors texte offrant une vision saisissante du relief de la France. Elle comporte egalement des mises au point originales de Jacques Bertin et constitue une synthese de ses demarches. Semiologie graphique apporte une reponse objective aux deux questions suivantes: dans quel cas faut-il faire un dessin? Quel dessin faut-il faire? La semiologie graphique remplace l'inventaire classique des formules graphiques par une analyse des moyens et des buts et par un ensemble de regles imperatives qui commandent la redaction graphique, c'est-a-dire le choix des correspondances entre les sensibilites visuelles disponibles et les elements de l'information."
46,Graphics and Graphic Information Processing,
47,"Semiology of graphics: Diagrams, networks, maps","Originally published in French in 1967, Semiology of Graphics is internationally recognized as a foundational work in the fields of design and cartography. Based on Jacques Bertin's practical experience as a cartographer, part one of this work is an unprecedented attempt to synthesize principles of graphic communication with the logic of standard rules applied to writing and topography. Part two brings Bertin's theory to life, presenting a close study of graphic techniques, including shape, orientation, color, texture, volume, and size, in an array of more than 1,000 maps and diagrams. Now, with a new epilogue written by the author shortly before his death, this new 2010 edition in English reawakens us to the information design possibilities of modern technology. Jacques Bertin was a French cartographer and theorist, and a world renowned authority on the subject of information visualization. In 1954, he founded the Cartographic Laboratory of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, and in 1957 he was named director of education. In 1967, Bertin became a professor at the Sorbonne, and in 1974 he was appointed director of education and director of the Geographical Laboratory of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. In the late 1970s, he became head of research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique."
48,Improving Layout Quality by Mixing Treemap-Layouts Based on Data-Change Characteristics,"This paper presents a hybrid treemap layout approach that optimizes layout-quality metrics by combining state-of-the-art treemap layout algorithms. It utilizes machine learning to predict those metrics based on data metrics describing the characteristics and changes of the dataset. For this, the proposed approach uses a neural network which is trained on artificially generated dataset,s containing a total of 15.8 million samples. The resulting model is integrated into an approach called Smart- Layouting. This approach is evaluated on real-world data from 100 publicly available software repositories. Compared to other state-of-the-art treemap algorithms it reaches an overall better result. Additionally, this approach can be customized by an end user's needs. The customization allows for specifying weights for the importance of each layout-quality metric. The results indicate, that the algorithm is able to adapt successfully towards a given set of weights."
49,Recursive binary tree layout mixing,"Binary tree layout with adequate boundary-I/O has been approached by mixing the H-layout and standard layout patterns. This paper proposes a recursive method of mixing these two tree layout patterns. Unlike the existing technique (of using a single continuous stretch of H-layout and then standard layout for the remaining tree levels), we propose to mix these two layout styles in a finer grain. The finer grain mixed pattern is then repeated to obtain an overall tree layout. This approach offers an order of area improvement over the existing single stretch layout mixing approaches, while retaining identical boundary-I/O. This makes the proposed approach an order of magnitude superior to the existing techniques."
50,Stacked trees: a new hybrid visualization method,"In this paper, we introduce a new Focus+Context visualization technique, named ``Stacked Trees'', allowing us to explore large dendrograms produced by hierarchical clustering. This approach displays up to fifty thousands nodes on a standard-sized screen."
51,Improving Visualization of Large Hierarchical Clustering,"The classical representation of a binary tree generated by a hierarchical clustering is a node-link-based visualization denoted as a dendrogram. It allows users to explore in a simple way the clusters and the relationships between instances. However, exploration of large dendrograms is known to be difficult due to the graphical and cognitive information overload involved. Here, we discuss the current approaches and we introduce Stacked Trees, a new Focus+Context visualization technique that allows the exploration of the hierarchical clustering of up to fifty thousands nodes on a standard-sized screen."
52,Extending Tree-Maps to Three Dimensions: A Comparative Study,"This paper presents StepTree, an information visualization tool designed for depicting hierarchies, such as directory structures. StepTree is similar to the hierarchy-visualization tool, Treemap, in that it uses a rectangular, space-filling methodology, but differs from Treemap in that it employs three-dimensional space, which is used to more clearly convey the structural relationships of the hierarchy. The paper includes an empirical study comparing typical search and analysis tasks using StepTree and Treemap. The study shows that users perform significantly better on tasks related to interpreting structural relationships when using StepTree. In addition, users achieved the same performance with StepTree and Treemap when doing a range of other common interpretative and navigational tasks."
53,The effect of animated transitions on user navigation in 3D Tree-maps,"This paper describes a user study conducted to evaluate the use of smooth animated transitions between directories in a three-dimensional, tree-map visualization. We looked specifically at the task of returning to a previously visited directory after either an animated or instantaneous return to the root location. The results of the study show that animation is a double-edged sword. Even though users take more shortcuts, they also make more severe navigational errors. It seems as though the promise of a more direct route to the target directory, which animation provides, somehow precludes users who navigate incorrectly from applying a successful recovery strategy."
54,Navigation Techniques for Zoomable Treemaps,This paper presents a new technique called zoomable treemaps that makes it possible to navigate in very large trees. It integrates several efficient interaction techniques that enable multi-scale and structure-aware navigation.
55,Browsing Zoomable Treemaps: Structure-Aware Multi-Scale Navigation Techniques,"Treemaps provide an interesting solution for representing hierarchical data. However, most studies have mainly focused on layout algorithms and paid limited attention to the interaction with treemaps. This makes it difficult to explore large data sets and to get access to details, especially to those related to the leaves of the trees. We propose the notion of zoomable treemaps (ZTMs), an hybridization between treemaps and zoomable user interfaces that facilitates the navigation in large hierarchical data sets. By providing a consistent set of interaction techniques, ZTMs make it possible for users to browse through very large data sets (e.g., 700,000 nodes dispatched amongst 13 levels). These techniques use the structure of the displayed data to guide the interaction and provide a way to improve interactive navigation in treemaps."
56,Treemaps zoomables: techniques d'interaction multi-'echelles pour les treemaps,"Some efficient visualizations (such as treemaps) have been proposed for trees, but the interaction they provide to explore and acces data is often poor, especially for very large trees. We have designed a consistent set of navigation techniques that makes it possible to use treemaps as zoomable interfaces. We introduce structure-aware navigation, the property of using the structure of the displayed information to guide navigation, property that our interaction techniques share."
57,Dendrogramix: A hybrid tree-matrix visualization technique to support interactive exploration of dendrograms,"Clustering is often a first step when trying to make sense of a large data set. A wide family of cluster analysis algorithms, namely hierarchical clustering algorithms, does not provide a partition of the data set but a hierarchy of clusters organized in a binary tree, known as a dendrogram. The dendrogram has a classical node-link representation used by experts for various tasks like: to decide which subtrees are actual clusters (e.g., by cutting the dendrogram at a given depth); to give those clusters a name by inspecting their content; etc. We present Dendrogramix, a hybrid tree-matrix interactive visualization of dendrograms that superimposes the relationship between individual objects on to the hierarchy of clusters. Dendrogramix enables users to do tasks which involve both clusters and individual objects that are impracticable with the classical representation, like: to explain why a particular objects belongs to a particular cluster; to elicit and understand uncommon patterns (e.g., objects that could have been classified in a totally different cluster); etc. Those sensemaking tasks are supported by a consistent set of interaction techniques that facilitates the exploration of large clustering results."
58,The DeepTree Exhibit: Visualizing the Tree of Life to Facilitate Informal Learning,"In this paper, we present the DeepTree exhibit, a multi-user, multi-touch interactive visualization of the Tree of Life. We developed DeepTree to facilitate collaborative learning of evolutionary concepts. We will describe an iterative process in which a team of computer scientists, learning scientists, biologists, and museum curators worked together throughout design, development, and evaluation. We present the importance of designing the interactions and the visualization hand-in-hand in order to facilitate active learning. The outcome of this process is a fractal-based tree layout that reduces visual complexity while being able to capture all life on earth; a custom rendering and navigation engine that prioritizes visual appeal and smooth fly-through; and a multi-user interface that encourages collaborative exploration while offering guided discovery. We present an evaluation showing that the large dataset encouraged free exploration, triggers emotional responses, and facilitates visitor engagement and informal learning."
59,Technical appendix: The DeepTree layout and rendering engine,This technical report provides details regarding the DeepTree layout and rendering engine
60,Aesthetic layout of generalized trees,"Research on the aesthetic layout of trees has been largely concerned with the special case of binary trees with small constant-sized nodes. Yet, without otherwise requiring the power of general graph-layout algorithms, many layout problems involve n-ary trees with variable-sized nodes. This paper addresses the general issue of the aesthetic layout of such trees. Two algorithms are presented for the layout of generalized trees, and general issues, such as appropriate aesthetics, are discussed. The algorithms described are suitable for such tasks as the layout of class hierarchies, directory trees and tableau-style proofs."
61,Bubble Trees -- The visualization of hierarchical information structures,"A tree visualization mechanism is proposed, based on the natural property of trees to recursively sub-categorize themselves into sub-trees. Each sub-tree is graphically represented as a bubble, which aggregates detail by enclosing lower-level information. Navigation and information retrieval are facilitated through an elegant set of browsing interactions. The interface is useful for tasks where users are required to develop a mental model of a classification system. The interactive nature of bubble trees allows users to explore and work out relationships for themselves."

63,DEXiTree: A program for pretty drawing of trees,"This paper presents DEXiTree, a computer program for drawing trees. In principle, DEXiTree is aimed at making nice drawings of attribute trees made by DEXi, a computer program for qualitative multi-attribute decision modelling. Apart from that, DEXiTree is quite a general and powerful tree-drawing program that implements four different tree-drawing algorithms (called Distribute, Align, Walker, and QP), draws trees in four different directions (top-down, left-right, bottom-up and right-left) and provides an extensive set of parameters for controlling the appearance of trees and their components. DEXiTree’s functionality includes loading a decision model from a DEXi file, interactively designing the tree layout, saving and loading the layout using an XML format, and rendering the drawing in two graphic formats: vector and raster."
64,Generative Design,"Generative design is a revolutionary new method of creating artwork, models, and animations from sets of rules, or algorithms. By using accessible programming languages such as Processing, artists and designers are producing extravagant, crystalline structures that can form the basis of anything from patterned textiles and typography to lighting, scientific diagrams, sculptures, films, and even fantastical buildings. Opening with a gallery of thirty-five illustrated case studies, Generative Design takes users through specific, practical instructions on how to create their own visual experiments by combining simple-to-use programming codes with basic design principles. A detailed handbook of advanced strategies provides visual artists with all the tools to achieve proficiency. Both a how-to manual and a showcase for recent work in this exciting new field, Generative Design is the definitive study and reference book that designers have been waiting for."
65,DensiTree: Making sense of sets of phylogenetic trees,"Bayesian analysis through programs like BEAST (Drummond and Rumbaut, 2007) and MrBayes (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001) provides a powerful method for reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. One of the benefits of Bayesian methods is that well-founded estimates of uncertainty in models can be made available. So, for example, not only the mean time of a most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) is estimated, but also the spread. This distribution over model space is represented by a set of trees, which can be rather large and difficult to interpret. DensiTree is a tool that helps navigating these sets of trees. The main idea behind DensiTree is to draw all trees in the set transparently. As a result, areas where a lot of the trees agree in topology and branch lengths show up as highly colored areas, while areas with little agreement show up as webs. This makes it possible to quickly get an impression of properties of the tree set such as well-supported clades, distribution of tMRCA and areas of topological uncertainty. Thus, DensiTree provides a quick method for qualitative analysis of tree sets."
66,DensiTree 2: Seeing trees through the forest,"Phylogenetic analysis like Bayesian MCMC or bootstrapping result in a collection of trees. Trees are discrete objects and it is generally difficult to get a mental grip on a distributions over trees. Visualisation tools like DensiTree can give good intuition on tree distributions. It works by drawing all trees in the set transparently thus highlighting areas where the tree in the set agrees. In this way, both uncertainty in clade heights and uncertainty in topology can be visualised. In our experience, a vanilla DensiTree can turn out to be misleading in that it shows too much uncertainty due to wrongly ordering taxa or due to unlucky placement of internal nodes. DensiTree is extended to allow visualisation of meta-data associated with branches such as population size and evolutionary rates. Furthermore, geographic locations of taxa can be shown on a map, making it easy to visually check there is some geographic pattern in a phylogeny. Taxa orderings have a large impact on the layout of the tree set, and advances have been made in finding better orderings resulting in significantly more informative visualisations. We also explored various methods for positioning internal nodes, which can improve the quality of the image. Together, these advances make it easier to comprehend distributions over trees."
67,Multilevel Compound Tree -- Construction Visualization and Interaction,"Several hierarchical clustering techniques have been proposed to visualize large graphs, but fewer solutions suggest a focus based approach. We propose a multilevel clustering technique that produces in linear time a contextual clustered view depending on a user-focus. We get a tree of clusters where each cluster - called meta-silhouette - is itself hierarchically clustered into an inclusion tree of silhouettes. Resulting Multilevel Silhouette Tree (MuSi-Tree) has a specific structure called multilevel compound tree. This work builds upon previous work on a compound tree structure called MO-Tree. The work presented in this paper is a major improvement over previous work by (1) defining multilevel compound tree as a more generic structure, (2) proposing original space-filling visualization techniques to display it, (3) defining relevant interaction model based on both focus changes and graph filtering techniques and (4) reporting from case studies in various fields: co-citation graphs, related-document graphs and social graphs."
68,Method and apparatus for visualization of database search results,"A method and apparatus for representing the results of a search of a database. The present invention provides for creating a view of database search results via a tree structure in which detail is selected and context preserved. In the present invention, the tree structure is created based on user specified parameters. These parameters represent attributes of documents stored in the database and may differ from the search parameters. The tree structure is then mapped to a static reference surface which is visually perceived as three-dimensional. The reference surface is comprised of a detail area where detail of the tree structure is displayed and a context area for displaying other portions of the tree in less detail but which conveys to the viewer a sense of context. The tree structure may be scrolled about the reference surface to bring portions of the structure into a direct detail view while retaining a context view of the overall tree."
69,Sphere-based Information Visualization: Challenges and Benefits,Use of a sphere as a basis for organizing an information visualization should balance issues such as occlusion against potential useful benefits such as natural navigational affordances and perceptual connotations of an application.
70,Graphic Presentation,"Graphic Presentation is largely a collection of interesting charts and pictures, mostly of a non-technical nature,covering a wide range of subject matter, with brief comment on methodology under each illustration. These charts and pictures are reproductions from numerous sources, including a few from his Graphic Methods. In addition to the chapters on types of charts and excerpts from Time Series Charts: A Manual of Design and Construction published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, there are some quasi-technical chapters on such things as the use of cameras and lantern slides, selection of paper, and methods of reproduction, printing, and binding. A chapter on tabulation is thrown in, apparently for good measure. Illustrations on alternate pairs of facing pages arc in color, and these pages contain also decorative chapter identification (bleed-outs) at the top and bottom. Printing was done by the photo offset process. The verbal language is Basic English. A minor feature of the book is a device whereby the reader may spin the pages rapidly until he reaches the desired chapter. On page 453 is given a detailed description of how the book was made up, including the names and addresses of the companies furnishing materials or services. This book departs from the earlier contribution in several respects. Text material is boiled down almost to the vanishing point, leaving the maximum number of charts to speak for themselves."
71,Visualization of Large-Scale Customer Satisfaction Surveys Using a Parallel Coordinate Tree,"Satisfaction surveys are an important measurement tool in fields such as market research or human resources management. Serious studies consist of numerous questions and contain answers from large population samples. Aggregation on both sides, the questions asked as well as the answers received, turns the multidimensional problem into a complex system of interleaved hierarchies. Traditional ways of presenting the results are limited to one-dimensional charts and cross-tables. We developed a visualization method called the Parallel Coordinate Tree that combines multidimensional analysis with a tree structure representation. Distortion-oriented focus+context techniques are used to facilitate interaction with the visualization. In this paper we present a design study of a commercial application that we built, using this method to analyze and communicate results from large-scale customer satisfaction surveys."
72,Drawing trees nicely with TeX,"Various algorithms have been proposed for the difficult problem of producing aesthetically pleasing drawings of trees, see Reingold and Tilford (1981), Wetherell and Shannon (1979) but implementations only exist as ``special purpose software'', designed for special environments. Therefore, many users resort to the drawing facilites available on most personal computers, but the figures obtained in this way still look ``hand-drawn''; their quality is inferior to the quality of the surrounding text that can be realized by today''s high quality text processing systems. In this paper we present an entirely new solution that integrates a tree drawing algorithm into one of the best text processing systems available. More precisely, we present a TeX macro package TreeTeX that produces a drawing of a tree from a purely logical description. Our approach has three advantages. First, labels for nodes can be handled in a reasonable way. On the one hand, the tree drawing algorithm can compute the widths of the labels and take them into account for the positioning of the nodes; on the other hand, all the textual parts of the document can be treated uniformly. Second, TreeTeX can be trivially ported to any site running TeX. Finally, modularity in the description of a tree and TeX's macro capabilities allow for libraries of subtrees and tree classes. In addition, we have implemented an option that produces drawing which make the structure of the trees more obvious to the human eye, even though they may not be as aesthetically pleasing."
73,Squarified Treemaps,"An extension to the treemap method for the visualization of hierarchical information, such as directory structures and organization structures, is presented. The standard treemap method often gives thin, elongated rectangles. As a result, rectangles are difficult to compare and to select. A new method is presented to generate lay-outs in which the rectangles approximate squares. To strenghten the visualization of the structure, shaded frames are used around groups of related nodes."
74,Drawing ordered $(k-1)$-ary trees on $k$-grids,"We explore the complexity of drawing ordered $(k-1)$-ary trees on grids with k directions for $kin4,6,8$ and within a given area. This includes, e.g., ternary trees drawn on the orthogonal grid. For aesthetically pleasing tree drawings on these grids, we additionally present various restrictions similar to the common hierarchical case. First, we generalize the NP-hardness of minimal width in hierarchical drawings of ordered trees to $(k-1)$-ary trees on k-grids and then we generalize the Reingold and Tilford algorithm to k-grids."
75,Improving Walker's Algorithm to Run in Linear Time,"The algorithm of Walker is widely used for drawing trees of unbounded degree, and it is widely assumed to run in linear time, as the author claims in his article. But the presented algorithm clearly needs quadraticrun time. We explain the reasons for that and present a revised algorithm that creates the same layouts in linear time."
76,Adjacency-Preserving Spatial Treemaps,"Rectangular layouts, subdivisions of an outer rectangle into smaller rectangles, have many applications in visualizing spatial information, for instance in rectangular cartograms in which the rectangles represent geographic or political regions. A spatial treemap is a rectangular layout with a hierarchical structure: the outer rectangle is subdivided into rectangles that are in turn subdivided into smaller rectangles. We describe algorithms for transforming a rectangular layout that does not have this hierarchical structure, together with a clustering of the rectangles of the layout, into a spatial treemap that respects the clustering and also respects to the extent possible the adjacencies of the input layout."

A spatial treemap is a rectangular layout with a hierarchical structure: the outer rectangle is subdivided into rectangles that are in turn subdivided into smaller rectangles. We describe algorithms for transforming a rectangular layout that does not have this hierarchical structure, together with a clustering of the rectangles of the layout, into a spatial treemap that respects the clustering and also respects to the extent possible the adjacencies of the input layout."
78,Angle-Restricted Steiner Arborescences for Flow Map Layout,"Flow maps visualize the movement of objects between places. One or more sources are connected to several targets by arcs whose thickness corresponds to the amount of flow between a source and a target. Flow maps reduce visual clutter by merging (bundling) lines smoothly and by avoiding self-intersections. We present algorithms that compute crossing-free flows of high visual quality. To this end we introduce a new variant of the geometric Steiner arborescence problem. The goal is to connect the targets to a source with a tree of minimal length whose arcs obey a certain restriction on the angle they form with the source. Such an angle-restricted Steiner arborescence, or simply flow tree, naturally induces a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundles arcs. We study the properties of optimal flow trees and show that they consist of logarithmic spirals and straight lines. Computing optimal flow trees is NP-hard. Hence we consider a variant of flow trees which uses only logarithmic spirals, so called spiral trees. Spiral trees approximate flow trees within a factor depending on the angle restriction. Computing optimal spiral trees remains NP-hard. We present an efficient 2-approximation for spiral trees, which can be extended to avoid certain types of obstacles."
79,Flow Map Layout via Spiral Trees,"Flow maps are thematic maps that visualize the movement of objects, such as people or goods, between geographic regions. One or more sources are connected to several targets by lines whose thickness corresponds to the amount of flow between a source and a target. Good flow maps reduce visual clutter by merging (bundling) lines smoothly and by avoiding self-intersections. Most flow maps are still drawn by hand and only few automated methods exist. Some of the known algorithms do not support edge-bundling and those that do, cannot guarantee crossing-free flows. We present a new algorithmic method that uses edge-bundling and computes crossing-free flows of high visual quality. Our method is based on so-called spiral trees, a novel type of Steiner tree which uses logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees naturally induce a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundle lines. Our flows can also avoid obstacles, such as map features, region outlines, or even the targets. We validate our approach with extensive experiments."
80,Angle-Restricted Steiner Arborescences for Flow Map Layout,"We introduce a new variant of the geometric Steiner arborescence problem, motivated by the layout of flow maps. Flow maps show the movement of objects between places. They reduce visual clutter by bundling lines smoothly and avoiding self-intersections. To capture these properties, our angle-restricted Steiner arborescences, or flux trees, connect several targets to a source with a tree of minimal length whose arcs obey a certain restriction on the angle they form with the source. We study the properties of optimal flux trees and show that they are planar and consist of logarithmic spirals and straight lines. Flux trees have the shallow-light property. We show that computing optimal flux trees is NP-hard. Hence we consider a variant of flux trees which uses only logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees approximate flux trees within a factor depending on the angle restriction. Computing optimal spiral trees remains NP-hard, but we present an efficient 2-approximation, which can be extended to avoid ``positive monotone'' obstacles."
81,Navigation in degree of interest trees,"We present an experiment that compares how people perform search tasks in a degree-of-interest browser and in a Windows-Explorer-like browser. Our results show that, whereas users do attend to more information in the DOI browser, they do not complete the task faster than in an Explorer-like browser. However, in both types of browser, users are faster to complete high information scent search tasks than low information scent tasks. We present an ACT-R computational model of the search task in the DOI browser. The model describes how a visual search strategy may combine with semantic aspects of processing, as captured by information scent. We also describe a way of automatically estimating information scent in an ontological hierarchy by querying a large corpus (in our case, Google's corpus)."
82,Modeling Navigation in Degree-of-Interest Trees,"We present an ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998) computational model of how people navigate in a degree-of-interest (DOI) tree. The model incorporates a visual salience function that determines which part of the display to attend to next. The salience function uses visual features of the display (e.g., distances) and semantic features of labels (e.g., information scent). The model was compared against data from participants and provided medium to strong fits to latencies and the number of nodes visited by the participants. The model shows that it is useful to distinguish between category-based versus similarity-based information scent. It also suggests that visual distance and scent may interact with one another, with scent playing a greater role at distances close to the current node in the visual focus."
83,Timeline Trees: visualizing sequences of transactions in information hierarchies,"In many applications transactions between the elements of an information hierarchy occur over time. For example, the product offers of a department store can be organized into product groups and subgroups to form an information hierarchy. A market basket consisting of the products bought by a customer forms a transaction. Market baskets of one or more customers can be ordered by time into a sequence of transactions. Each item in a transaction is associated with a measure, for example, the amount paid for a product. In this paper we present a novel method for visualizing sequences of these kinds of transactions in information hierarchies. It uses a tree layout to draw the hierarchy and a timeline to represent progression of transactions in the hierarchy. We have developed several interaction techniques that allow the users to explore the data. Smooth animations help them to track the transitions between views. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by examples from several very different application domains."
84,Indented Pixel Tree Plots,"We introduce Indented Pixel Tree Plots (IPTPs): a novel pixel-based visualization technique for depicting large hierarchies. It is inspired by the visual metaphor of indented outlines, omnipresent in graphical file browsers and pretty printing of source code. Inner vertices are represented as vertically arranged lines and leaf groups as horizontally arranged lines. A recursive layout algorithm places parent nodes to the left side of their underlying tree structure and leaves of each subtree grouped to the rightmost position. Edges are represented only implicitly by the vertically and horizontally aligned structure of the plot, leading to a sparse and redundant-free visual representation. We conducted a user study with 30 subjects in that we compared IPTPs and node-link diagrams as a within-subjects variable. The study indicates that working with IPTPs can be learned in less than 10 minutes. Moreover, IPTPs are as effective as node-link diagrams for accuracy and completion time for three typical tasks; participants generally preferred IPTPs. We demonstrate the usefulness of IPTPs by understanding hierarchical features of huge trees such as the NCBI taxonomy with more than 300,000 nodes."
85,Visualizing Dynamic Quantitative Data in Hierarchies. TimeEdgeTrees: Attaching Dynamic Weights to Tree Edges,"In this paper we introduce a technique for visualizing the dynamics of quantitative data in static hierarchical structures. We exploit the straight links of orthogonal tree diagrams as a timeline on which we visually encode dynamic quantitative information. We use color coding and varying thicknesses to represent the time-varying data. Bimodal data can also be displayed by exploiting both sides of the time axes simultaneously. Our TimeEdgeTrees tool allows us to explore dynamic quantitative data in tree diagrams by interactive data filtering and zooming. The spatial proximity of neighboring hierarchically structured elements allows us to easily explore trends, countertrends, periodicity, temporal shifts, or anomalies during the evolution synchronously. Interactive features such as expanding or collapsing of subhierarchies additionally help to detect the aforementioned phenomena on different levels of granularity. The usefulness of our visualization technique is illustrated by water level data acquired at more than 450 measurement stations along German rivers for 768 points in time."
86,Indented Pixel Tree Browser for Exploring Huge Hierarchies,"In this paper we introduce the Indented Pixel Tree Browser -- an interactive tool for exploring, annotating, and comparing huge hierarchical structures on different levels of granularity. We exploit the indented visual metaphor to map tree structures to one-dimensional zigzag curves to primarily achieve an overview representation for the entire hierarchy. We focus on space-efficiency and simultaneous uncovering of tree-specific phenomena. Each displayed plot can be filtered for substructures that are mapped to a larger space and hence, unhide more fine-granular substructures that are hidden in the compressed overview. By representing tree structures side-by-side, the viewer can easily compare them visually and detect similar patterns and also anomalies. In our approach, we follow the information seeking mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand. More interactive features such as expanding and collapsing of nodes, applying different color codings, or distorting the tree horizontally as well as vertically support a viewer when exploring huge hierarchical data sets. The usefulness of our interactive browsing tool is demonstrated in a case study for the NCBI taxonomy that contains 324,276 species and organisms that are hierarchically organized."
87,"Enriching Indented Pixel Tree Plots with Node-Oriented Quantitative, Categorical, Relational, and Time-Series Data","Indented Pixel Tree Plots are useful for an overview of large and deep hierarchical data. As a major benefit, these plots scale to pixel or even subpixel resolution, still clearly visualizing the hierarchical structures and substructures in a redundant-free representation. Consequently, there is display space available that may be used to show additional information such as enlarged or filtered subregions, details-on-demand, or control panels. In this paper, we demonstrate how this compact indented diagram can be enriched with additional data associated with both leaf and inner nodes of the hierarchy. To this end, we support quantitative, categorical, relational, and time-series data. By such a combination, exploration and analysis of visual patterns and anomalies on different levels of hierarchical granularity are possible in a static diagram. Furthermore, interactive features such as expanding/collapsing of subhierarchies, horizontal/vertical distortions, zooming in/out, or details-on-demand are integrated to allow the user to inspect the data from different viewpoints. The usefulness of the enriched diagrams is illustrated by applying them to file system data where single software constructs are hierarchically organized. Here, we focus on quantitative, categorical, and relational data attached to the nodes of the hierarchy. In a second case study, we demonstrate how evolving water level data of rivers in Germany can be represented by our plots."
88,Method and apparatus for improving the visibility of a Treemap,"The visibility of a treemap is improved by offsetting the area of a parent node relative to a bounding box containing all of its child nodes while constructing the treemap, so that a part of the bounding box lies outside the area of the parent node, and the area of each child node in the bounding box is located entirely or partially within the area of the parent node. The present invention highlights the parent-child relationships in the treemap with a cascading effect to make the structural information therein more apparent and easier to recognize."
89,Method and apparatus for generating 3D Carousel Tree data visualization and related device,"A method for generating 3D carousel visualization of large-scale tree data, which comprises the steps of: receiving a user's selection of a node in the carousel; according to the radius of a sub-carousel corresponding to the user-selected node and the radius of a carousel at which the selected node is located, judging whether or not the sub-carousel can be expanded at the carousel at which the selected node is located; expanding the sub-carousel at the carousel at which the selected node is located, if it is determined that the sub-carousel can be expanded at the carousel at which the selected node is located. A device capable of implementing the method is provided. The number of carousel levels visualized on a visualization device can be adjusted dynamically, and the visualization of a focus becomes more prominent, and relationships between nodes at each level of the tree data visualization get more apparent."
90,Degree-of-interest trees: a component of an attention-reactive user interface,"This paper proposes Degree-of-Interest trees. These trees use degree-of-interest calculations and focus+context visualization methods, together with bounding constraints, to fit within pre-established bounds. The method is an instance of an emerging ""attention-reactive"" user interface whose components are designed to snap together in bounded spaces."
91,System and method for browsing hierarchically based node-link structures based on an estimated degree of interest,"Method and system to enable a user to view large collections of hierarchically linked information on a computer based display. A tree structure visualization is created which presents a representation of the complete collection of information on the display. The visualization fits completely within a fixed area of the computer based display, negating the need to scroll information into the display area. The visualization is based on identified focus nodes and through calculation of a Degree of Interest (DOI) for each of the nodes based in the structure. Layout and presentation of the visualization structure is based on the DOI values in combination with considerations of available display space. A user may dynamically manipulate views of the structure by selecting one or more focus nodes, thus causing a recalculation of the degree of interest."
92,TimeTree: Exploring Time Changing Hierarchies,"Intelligence analysis often involves the task of gathering information about an organization. Knowledge about individuals in an organization and their relationships, often represented as a hierarchical organization chart, is crucial for understanding the organization. However, it is difficult for intelligence analysts to follow all individuals in an organization. Existing hierarchy visualizations have largely focused on the visualization of fixed structures and can not effectively depict the evolution of a hierarchy over time. We introduce TimeTree, a novel visualization tool designed to enable exploration of a changing hierarchy. TimeTree enables analysts to navigate the history of an organization, identify events associated with a specific entity (visualized on a TimeSlider), and explore an aggregate view of an individual's career path (a CareerTree). We demonstrate the utility of TimeTree by investigating a set of scenarios developed by an expert intelligence analyst. The scenarios are evaluated using a real dataset composed of eighteen thousand career events from more than eight thousand individuals. Insights gained from this analysis are presented."
93,Trees with convex faces and optimal angles,"We consider drawings of trees in which all edges incident to leaves can be extended to infinite rays without crossing, partitioning the plane into infinite convex polygons. Among all such drawings we seek the one maximizing the angular resolution of the drawing. We find linear time algorithms for solving this problem, both for plane trees and for trees without a fixed embedding. In any such drawing, the edge lengths may be set independently of the angles, without crossing; we describe multiple strategies for setting these lengths."
94,PhylloTrees: Harnessing Nature's Phyllotactic Patterns for Tree Layout,"We explore the use of nature’s phyllotactic patterns to inform the layout of hierarchical data. These naturally occurring patterns provide a non-overlapping, optimal packing when the total number of nodes is not known a priori. We present a family of expandable tree layouts based on these patterns."
95,Research report. Interacting with huge hierarchies: Beyond Cone Trees,"The paper describes an implementation of a tool for visualizing and interacting with huge information hierarchies, and some preliminary empirical evaluation of the tool's efficacy. Existing systems for visualizing huge hierarchies using cone trees ""break down"" once the hierarchy to be displayed exceeds roughly 1000 nodes, due to increasing visual clutter. The paper describes a system called fsviz which visualizes arbitrarily large hierarchies while retaining user control. This is accomplished by augmenting cone trees with several graphical and interaction techniques: usage-based filtering, animated zooming, hand-coupled rotation, fish-eye zooming, coalescing of distant nodes, texturing, effective use of colour for depth cueing, and the applications of dynamic queries. The fsviz system also improves upon earlier cone tree visualization systems through a more elaborate node layout algorithm. This algorithm enhances the usefulness of cone tree visualization for large hierarchies by all but eliminating clutter."
96,The Bifocal Tree: A Technique for the Visualization of Hierarchical Information Structures,"This paper reports a new technique for visualizing hierarchies which is based on the focus+context concept, but uses two foci instead of one. The technique allows improving the presentation of details related to some item in the information space as well as the context. This is achieved by displaying the hierarchy as a node-edge diagram separated in two connected sub-diagrams. One corresponds to the subtree with the node of interest as root. The other one represents the context and contains the selected node parent and remaining subtrees. Interaction issues regarding browsing and other operations are also discussed."
97,A heuristic extending the Squarified treemapping algorithm,"A heuristic extending the Squarified Treemap technique for the representation of hierarchical information as treemaps is presented. The original technique gives high quality treemap views, since items are laid out with rectangles that approximate squares, allowing easy comparison and selection operations. New key steps, with a low computational impact, have been introduced to yield treemaps with even better aspect ratios and higher homogeneity among items."
98,A Self-adaptive Treemap-based Technique for Visualizing Hierarchical Data in 3D,"In this paper, we present a novel adaptive visualization technique where the constituting polygons dynamically change their geometry and other visual attributes depending on user interaction. These changes take place with the objective of conveying required level of detail to the user through each view. Our proposed technique is successfully applied to build a treemap-based but 3D visualization of hierarchical data, a widely used information structure. This new visualization exploits its adaptive nature to address issues like cluttered display, imperceptible hierarchy, lack of smooth zoom-in and out technique which are common in tree visualization. We also present an algorithm which utilizes the flexibility of our proposed technique to deal with occlusion, a problem inherent in any 3D information visualization. On one hand, our work establishes adaptive visualization as a means of displaying tree-structured data in 3D. On the other, it promotes the technique as a potential candidate for being employed to visualize other information structures also."
99,Analysis and extension of tree visualization,"Information visualization has always attracted human eye, as visual representation and interaction techniques allows one's mind to explore and understand large amount of information at a glance. Various information visualization techniques have been developed to show results in novel forms like graph drawing, hyperbolic tree, tree mapping and many more. Some recent development in visualization techniques has been done using fractal grammar and adoption for some existing aesthetic forms. This thesis presents how the existing algorithm of tree-mapping can be made more interactive and informative for end users. By adding level based information display, displaying communities in tree and treemap and animating the tree drawing adds more readability and reduces ambiguity of treemap. We will also discuss, what are various ways for data to be extracted and how new information can be derived from a given data set."
100,A Magic Treemap Cube for Visualizing Olympic Games Data,"Treemap, a common information visualization approach for dividing a display area into nested rectangles, has a good performance on visualizing hierarchical data. And it enables user to compare nodes in the same level and to learn certain relationship between adjacent levels. However, treemap layout is limited to visualize multi-dimensional hierarchical data in which the hierarchy is unfixed and complex, especially when the hierarchy is an arbitrary graph. Considering this problem, we present a novel extension called magic treemap cube, which improves the layout and has a good performance on visualizing unfixed (cross-level) and complex data, inverting hierarchy without reorganizing the structure, and enabling users to easily compare among treemaps. The magic treemap cube is a three-dimensional regular hexahedron whose six faces are covered by six different treemaps. Each dimension of the magic treemap cube is a hierarchy structure specified by users according to a hierarchical division of visualization information. With the treemap algorithm, tagcloud and mapping rules, the treemaps are automatically controlled by permutations of three dimensions of the cube. Users could observe the six correlative treemaps respectively by rotating the magic treemap cube in three dimensional Cartesian coordinate. And this magic treemap cube can be unfolded into a tiled treemap in 2D Cartesian coordinate for users-friendly comparison of each treemap. Meanwhile, a merging operation to the tiled treemap is proposed to not only compare two treemaps through the adjacency relations among faces but also provide more information. For demonstrating the above characteristics, an application (called OlympicVis) has been implemented to visualize the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games information, which involves multi-dimensional hierarchy and interconnected data. The OlympicVis can display Cube View, Schedule View, Medal View, Date Filter and Time Line."
101,Sunburst with ordered nodes based on hierarchical clustering: A visual analyzing method for associated hierarchical pesticide residue data,"According to the characteristics of pesticide residue data and analyzing requirements in food safety fields, we presented a visual analyzing method for associated hierarchical data, called sunburst with ordered nodes based on hierarchical clustering (SONHC). SONHC arranged the leaf nodes in sunburst in order using hierarchical clustering algorithm, put the associated dataset as a node in center of the sunburst, and connected it with the associated leaf nodes in sunburst using colored lines. So, it can present not only two hierarchical structures but also the relationships between them. Based on SONHC and some interaction techniques (clicking, contraction and expansion, etc) we developed an associated visual analyzing system (AVAS) for pesticide residues detection results data, which can help users to inspect the hierarchical structure of pesticide and agricultural products and to explore the associations between pesticides and agricultural products, and associations between different pesticides. The results of user experience test showed that SONHC algorithm overperforms than SA and SR algorithm in ULE and ULE’s variance. AVAS system is effective in helping users to analyze the pesticide residues data. Furthermore, SONHC algorithm can also be adopted to analyze associated hierarchical data in other fields, such as finance, insurance and e-commerce."
102,Structural Analysis and Visualization of C++ Code Evolution using Syntax Trees,"We present a method to detect and visualize evolution patterns in C++ source code. Our method consists of three steps. First, we extract an annotated syntax tree (AST) from each version of a given C++ source code. Next, we hash the extracted syntax nodes based on a metric combining structure and type information, and construct matches (correspondences) between similar-hash subtrees. Our technique detects code fragments which have not changed, or changed little, during the software evolution. By parameterizing the similarity metric, we can flexibly decide what is considered to be identical or not during the software evolution. Finally, we visualize the evolution of the code structure by emphasizing both changing and constant code patterns. We demonstrate our technique on a versioned code base containing a variety of changes ranging from simple to complex."
103,Modified RELT for Display and Navigation of Large Hierarchy on Handheld Touch-Screen Devices,"Visualizing and exploring a hierarchical structure on a smartphone screen is challenging. On larger screens of PCs and laptops these types of structures are often shown in a tabular view. Due to the width restriction, tabular view is not feasible on smaller screens. This paper presents a visualization technique that displays multiple levels of a hierarchical structure on a single view for small screens and allows users to explore the structure rapidly through touch input. The visualization technique makes full use of the available space and distributes the space fairly among nodes. The system allows selection and display of relevant information based on user query or user habit, while hiding less important items from the view."
104,ERELT: a faster alternative to the list-based interfaces for tree exploration and searching in mobile devices,"This paper presents ERELT (Enhanced Radial Edgeless Tree), a tree visualization approach on modern mobile devices. ERELT is designed to offer a clear visualization of any tree structure with intuitive interaction. We are interested in both the observation and navigation of such structures. Such visualization can assist users in interacting with a hierarchical structure such as a media collection, file system, etc. In the ERELT visualization, a subset of the tree is displayed at a time. The displayed tree size depends on the maximum number of tree elements that can be put on the screen while maintaining clarity. Users can quickly navigate to the hidden parts of the tree through touch-based gestures. We conducted a user study to evaluate this visualization for a music collection. Test results show that this approach reduces the time and effort in navigating tree structures for exploration and search tasks."

Users can quickly navigate to the hidden parts of the tree through touch-based gestures. We have conducted a user study to evaluate this visualization for a music collection. The study results show that this approach reduces the time and effort in navigating tree structures for exploration and search tasks."
106,Extending the utility of treemaps with flexible hierarchy,"Treemaps are a visualization technique for presenting hierarchical information on two-dimensional displays. Prior implementations limit the visualization to pre-defined static hierarchies. Flexible hierarchy, a new capability of Treemap 4.0, enables users to define various hierarchies through dynamically selecting a series of data attributes so that they can discover patterns, clusters and outliers. This work describes the design and implementation issues of flexible hierarchy. It then reports on a usability study, which led to enhancements to the interface."
107,Strata Treemaps,"Treemap is a method of visualization to recognize a hierarchical structure of data using the size and arrangement of nested rectangles. A limitation of a treemap is the difficulty to discern the structure of a hierarchy. Several approaches have been proposed to improve the visibility of the hierarchical structure. These approaches involve the use of a border or padding to emphasize the hierarchical structure. However, this leads to a disparity between the node weight and the relative node size."
108,Dynamic Aggregation with Circular Visual Designs,"One very effective method for managing large data sets is aggregation or binning. We consider two aggregation methods that are tightly coupled with interactive manipulation and the visual representation of the data. Through this integration we hope to provide effective support for the aggregation process, specifically by enabling: 1) automatic aggregation, 2) continuous change and control of the aggregation level, 3) spatially based aggregates, 4) context maintenance across different aggregate levels, and 5) feedback on the level of aggregation."
109,Visualization of Syntax Tree Based on VML,"In the Chinese teaching and research, it often needs to draw syntax tree for the analyzing of relationship among compositions of sentence. Drawn syntax tree manually has many defects, such as having huge workload, needing immense storage capacity and so on. So it is of importance to do research of automatically generating syntax tree and its visualization. In this paper, it proposes a method to generate syntax tree automatically and display the syntax tree in web page by using VML technology. By comparing the syntax trees generated in this paper with the syntax trees got from Treebank of PKU, the result shows that the method of coordinate computing proposed in this paper is more precision, which also demonstrates the efficiency of the visualization method."
110,Virtual Worlds for Software Visualisation,"Understanding, quickly, completely and correctly, is crucial to every phase of the software development process. As system size and complexity continues to grow, effective visualisation of system components, together with their properties and relationships, becomes increasingly important in achieving understanding. Virtual worlds allow more information to be presented in visualisations while minimising the impact of cognitive information overload. In this paper, we describe our application of virtual worlds to visualisation of software engineering artifacts and present some examples from our work on object oriented software systems."
111,CHIVE -- A program source visualisation framework,"The CHIVE visualisation framework is an attempt to provide program comprehension and visualisation tool developers with a flexible means for creating 3-dimensional visualisations of hierarchies such as those that occur in program source. The CHIVE framework supports user definable datasets, multiple graph layouts and an environment in which users can interact with visualisations created from applying a graph layout to a dataset."
112,Methods and devices for mapping data files,"A method of mapping interconnections between a plurality of data files, such as files of the world wide web. The method comprises a step of, for a first file, in a display area displaying a first region. Then, according to a first distance scale, displaying one or more second regions, which respectively represent one or more second files logically related to the first file, for example by hyperlinks. The second regions are spatially related in a display to the first region. In (n-1) further steps, i=2,... , n, the method displays according to an i-th distance scale smaller than the (i-1)-th distance scale one or more (i+1)-th regions. Each of these (i+1)-th regions respectively represent one or more (i+1)-th files which are logically related to the i-th file, and they are spatially related on a display to the i-th region representing that i-th file. The method may be implemented in software, for example in a web browser."
113,Methods and devices for selecting items such as data files,"A method is described for allowing a user to select one of a plurality of items. The user employs a device having a display area, and a joystick or a contact sensitive area. The device displays a number of regions equal to the number of items, and defines a number of sections in the angular range of the joystick, or sections within the contact sensitive area, equal to the number of items, and arranged corresponding to the arrangement of the regions of the display area. The user selects one of said items by selecting the corresponding section."
114,An Evaluation of Cone Trees,"Cone Trees are an appealing interactive 3D visualization technique for hierarchical data structures. They were originally intended to maximise effective use of available screen space and to better exploit the abilities of the human perceptual system. Prior work has focused on the fidelity of the visualization rather than providing empirical user studies. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a low-fidelity animated and rapidly interactive 3D cone tree system. Results of the evaluation show that our subjects were slower at locating data using cone trees than when using a 'normal' tree browser, and that their performance deteriorated rapidly as the branching factor of the data-structure increased. Qualitative results, however, indicate that the subjects were enthusiastic about the cone tree visualization and that they felt it provided a better 'feel' for the structure of the information space."
115,DocuBurst: Visualizing Document Content using Language Structure,"Textual data is at the forefront of information management problems today. One response has been the development of visualizations of text data. These visualizations, commonly based on simple attributes such as relative word frequency, have become increasingly popular tools. We extend this direction, presenting the first visualization of document content which combines word frequency with the human-created structure in lexical databases to create a visualization that also reflects semantic content. DocuBurst is a radial, space-filling layout of hyponymy (the IS-A relation), overlaid with occurrence counts of words in a document of interest to provide visual summaries at varying levels of granularity. Interactive document analysis is supported with geometric and semantic zoom, selectable focus on individual words, and linked access to source text."
116,A note on optimal area algorithms for upward drawings of binary trees,"The goal of this paper is to investigate the area requirements for upward grid drawings of binary trees. First, we show that there is a family of binary trees with n vertices that require w(n*logn) area; this bound is tight to within a constant factor, i.e. any binary tree with n vertices can be drawn in O(n*logn) area. Then we present an algorithm for constructing an upward drawing of a complete binary tree with n vertices in O(n) area, and, finally, we extend this result to the drawings of Fibonacci trees."
117,Minimum-area h-v drawings of complete binary trees,"We study the area requirement of h-v drawings of complete binary trees. An h-v drawing of a binary tree t is a drawing of t such that (a) nodes are points with integer coordinates, (b) each edge is either a rightward-horizontal or a downward-vertical straight-line segment from a node to one of its children, (c) edges do not intersect, and (d) if t 1 and t 2 are immediate subtrees of a node u, the enclosing rectangles of the drawings of t 1 and t 2 are disjoint. We prove that, for any complete binary tree t of height h SQRT((n+1)/2)+3.5 if h is odd, (b) 2.5n–3.25SQRT(n+1)+3.5 otherwise. As far as we know, this is one of the few examples in which a closed formula for the minimum-area drawing of a graph has been explicitly found. Furthermore this minimum-area h-v drawing can be constructed in linear time. As a consequence of this result and the result of Trevisan (1996), we have that h-v drawings are provably less area-efficient than strictly upward drawings when we restrict ourselves to complete binary trees. We also give analogous results for the minimum-perimeter and the minimum-enclosing square area h-v drawings."
118,FundExplorer: Supporting the diversification of mutual fund portfolios using Context Treemaps,"An equity mutual fund is a financial instrument that invests in a set of stocks. Any two different funds may partially invest in some of the same stocks, thus overlap is common. Portfolio diversification aims at spreading an investment over many different stocks in search of greater returns. Helping people with portfolio diversification is challenging because it requires informing them about both their current portfolio of stocks held through funds and the other stocks in the market not invested in yet. Current stock/fund visualization systems either waste screen real estate and visualization of all data points. We have developed a system called FundExplorer that implements a distorted treemap to visualize both the amount of money invested in a person's fund portfolio and the context of remaining market stocks. The FundExplorer system enables people to interactively explore diversification possibilities with their portfolios."
119,Point Placement by Phylogenetic Trees and its Application to Visual Analysis of Document Collections,"The task of building effective representations to visualize and explore collections with moderate to large number of documents is hard. It depends on the evaluation of some distance measure among texts and also on the representation of such relationships in bi- dimensional spaces. In this paper we introduce an alternative approach for building visual maps of documents based on their content similarity, through reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. The tree is capable of representing relationships that allows the user to quickly recover information detected by the similarity metric. For a variety of text collections of different natures we show that we can achieve improved exploration capability and more clear visualization of relationships amongst documents."
120,Double Tree: An Advanced KWIC Visualization for Expert Users,"In this paper we present Double Tree, a new visualization of Key Word In Context (KWIC) displays targeted to support linguistic analysis. Inspired by Wattenberg's and Viegas' Word Tree visualization, Double Tree extends the idea of representing KWIC results as trees. We address several issues with Word Trees with respect to the specific demands of linguists and discuss the design decisions and implementation details that we chose for Double Tree. In particular we present our approach for displaying a two-sided tree. We describe details of the layout, including how frequency and linguistic information is incorporated, and what user interaction is supported. We conclude with some consideration on possible next steps for Double Tree."
121,Collapsible Cylindrical Trees: A Fast Hierarchical Navigation Technique,"This paper proposes a new visualization and interaction technique for medium-sized trees, called Collapsible Cylindrical Trees (CCT). Child nodes are mapped on rotating cylinders, which will be dynamically displayed or hidden to achieve a useful balance of detail and context. Besides a comprehensible three-dimensional visualization of trees, the main feature of CCT is a very fast and intuitive interaction with the displayed nodes. Only a single click is needed to reach every node and perform an action on it, such as displaying a web page. The CCT browsing technique was developed for interaction with web hierarchies but is not limited to this domain. We also present sample implementations of CCT using VRML, which show the usefulness of this intuitive tree navigation technique."
122,CactusTree: A tree drawing approach for hierarchical edge bundling,"This paper introduces CactusTree, a novel visualization technique for representing hierarchical datasets. We introduce details about the construction of CactusTrees and describe how they can be used to represent nested data and relationships between elements in the data. We explain how our design decisions were informed by tasks common to a range of scientific domains. A key contribution of this article is the introduction of descriptive features that can be used to characterize trees in terms of their structural and connective qualities."
123,A User Study of Techniques for Visualizing Structure and Connectivity in Hierarchical Datasets,"Many tree layouts have been created for presenting hierarchical data. However, layouts optimized for some tasks are not adequate for others. In this paper, we focus on identifying tree structures and cross-links generated by hierarchical edge bundling. Our key contribution is the introduction of descriptive features that can be used to characterize trees in terms of their structural and connective qualities. We present a user study with 14 subjects that provides an evaluation of our approach in comparison to other popular tree visualization techniques. The results of the study indicate which techniques are more effective for visual analysis tasks that involve identifying and comparing tree and subtree structures and/or visualizing connections using hierarchical edge bundling."
124,Embedding Stacked Polytopes on a Polynomial-Size Grid,"We show how to realize a stacked 3D polytope (formed by repeatedly stacking a tetrahedron onto a triangular face) by a strictly convex embedding with its n vertices on an integer grid of size $O(n^4)times O(n^4)times O(n^18)$. We use a perturbation technique to construct an integral 2D embedding that lifts to a small 3D polytope, all in linear time. This result solves a question posed by G""unter M. Ziegler, and is the first nontrivial subexponential upper bound on the long-standing open question of the grid size necessary to embed arbitrary convex polyhedra, that is, about efficient versions of Steinitz's 1916 theorem. An immediate consequence of our result is that $O(log n)$-bit coordinates suffice for a greedy routing strategy in planar 3-trees."
125,Infinite trees and the future,"We study the problem of designing layout facilities for the navigation of an ""infinite"" graph, i.e. a graph that is so large that its visualization is unfeasible, even by gluing together all the screen snapshots that a user can take during the navigation. We propose a framework for designing layout facilities that support the navigation of an infinite tree. The framework allows to exploit the knowledge of future moves of the user in order to reduce the changes in her mental map during the navigation. Variants of the classical Reingold-Tilford algorithm are presented and their performance is studied both experimentally and analytically."
126,Finding and Understanding Reusable Designs from Large Hierarchical Repositories,"This paper describes a prototype called CoMem (Corporate Memory) that supports the finding and understanding of useful items in large hierarchical repositories. The particular domain is civil engineering design, and the prototype is designed specifically to support design reuse in building construction projects. However, the underlying visualization and interaction principals behind CoMem are generalizable to the ubiquitous task of finding and understanding useful information in large hierarchical repositories. To support the finding, the entire hierarchy is visualized using a squarified treemap. Once an item from the treemap is selected, CoMem supports the understanding of that item by identifying related items in the hierarchy and visualizing the selected item in the context of these related items in a node-link diagram. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of a usability evaluation of CoMem that supports the claim that finding and understanding improve the process of reuse, and that the described visualizations assist with finding and understanding."
127,Understanding the use of inheritance with visual patterns,"The goal of this work is to visualize inheritance in object-oriented programs to help its comprehension. We propose a single, compact view of all class hierarchies at once using a custom Sunburst layout. It enables to quickly discover interesting facts across classes while preserving the essential relationship between parent and children classes. We explain how standard inheritance metrics are mapped into our visualization. Additionally, we define a new metric characterizing similar children classes. Using these metrics and the proposed layout, a set of common visual patterns is derived. These patterns allow the programmer to quickly understand how inheritance is used and provide answers to some essential questions when performing program comprehension tasks. Our approach is evaluated through a case study that involves examples from large programs, demonstrating its scalability."
128,Lifemap: Exploring the entire Tree of Life,"The Tree of Life (ToL) is meant to be a unique representation of the evolutionary relationships between all species on earth. Huge efforts are made to assemble such a large tree, helped by the decrease of sequencing costs and improved methods to reconstruct and combine phylogenies, but no tool exists today to explore the ToL in its entirety in a satisfying manner. By combining methods used in modern cartography, such as OpenStreetMap, with a new way of representing tree-like structures, I created Lifemap, a tool allowing the exploration of a complete representation of the ToL (between 800,000 and 2.2 million species depending on the data source) in a zoomable interface. A server version of Lifemap also allows users to visualize their own trees. This should help researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology in their everyday work, but may also permit the diffusion to a broader audience of our current knowledge of the evolutionary relationships linking all organisms."
129,The botanical beauty of random binary trees,"We present a simple mechanism for quickly rendering computer images of botanical trees based on random binary trees commonly found in computer science. That is, we visualize abstract binary trees as botanical ones. We generate random binary trees by splitting based upon the beta distribution, and obtain the standard binary search trees as a special case. We draw them in PostScript to resemble actual botanical trees found in nature. Through flexible parameterization and extensive randomization, we can produce a rich collection of images."
130,Architectures to make simple visualisations using simple systems,"In previous work, the first author argued for simple lightweight visualisations. These are surprisingly complex to produce due to the need for infrastructure to read files, etc. onCue, a desktop 'agent', aids the rapid production of such visualisations and their integration with desktop and Internet applications. Two examples are used dancing histograms for 2D tables and pieTrees for hierarchical numeric data. A major focus is the importance of architecture, both that of onCue itself and the underlying component infrastructure on which it is built - separation of concerns, mixed initiative computation and plug-and-play components lead to easily produced and easily used systems."
131,Node-Link and Containment Methods in Ontology Visualization,"OWL Ontology language can be very expressive. This could provide difficulty in ontology understanding process. We belief, that an ontology visualization equipped with intuitive interactions can simplify this process, and help the user during ontology exploration and development. We introduce an approach representing an ontology with two different tree visualization techniques: the node-link technique, and the containment technique. These two representations show the structure of an ontology differently. The former, represents an ontology as a graph structure. This graph structure, based on the ontology hierarchy and properties, can be explored in different geometries: Euclidean, hyperbolic and spherical. The second representation shows only the hierarchical structure. The design of the containment approach is implemented in a non-standard way. In place of traditional two-dimensional space-filling techniques, we elaborate on the sphere-packing approach and make our hierarchy visualization three-dimensional. We augment this technique with the semantic zoom functionality, where the level of detail is a function of a distance from the viewer."
132,Interactive Fan Charts: A Space-Saving Technique for Genealogical Graph Exploration,"Fan charts are a popular method for displaying family trees in a compact way. We extend the concept of fan charts to include a number of interactive metaphors, thus transforming what was a static display medium into an interactive tool for browsing and editing genealogical data."
133,Nmap: A Novel Neighborhood Preservation Space-filling Algorithm,"Space-filling techniques seek to use as much as possible the visual space to represent a dataset, splitting it into regions that represent the data elements. Amongst those techniques, Treemaps have received wide attention due to its simplicity, reduced visual complexity, and compact use of the available space. Several different Treemap algorithms have been proposed, however the core idea is the same, to divide the visual space into rectangles with areas proportional to some data attribute or weight. Although pleasant layouts can be effectively produced by the existing techniques, most of them do not take into account relationships that might exist between different data elements when partitioning the visual space. This violates the distance-similarity metaphor, that is, close rectangles do not necessarily represent similar data elements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Neighborhood Treemap (Nmap), that seeks to solve this limitation by employing a slice and scale strategy where the visual space is successively bisected on the horizontal or vertical directions and the bisections are scaled until one rectangle is defined per data element. Compared to the current techniques with the same similarity preservation goal, our approach presents the best results while being two to three orders of magnitude faster. The usefulness of Nmap is shown by two applications involving the organization of document collections and the construction of cartograms illustrating its effectiveness on different scenarios."
134,To treat of the world -- Paul Otlet's ontology and epistemology and the circle of knowledge,"The purpose of this paper is to document how Paul Otlet, founding-father of what is termed at present as information science, attempted to provide a complete image of the world (and reality in general) by establishing the scientific discipline he dubbed documentation. The paper also aims to focus on how Otlet represented human knowledge and reality in a systematic and unified way. Most importantly, it is shown that Otlet's views on documentation were immersed in a cosmological, objectivist, humanitarian and ontological framework that is alien to contemporary information science. Correspondingly, his alleged affinity with positivism is reassessed."
135,Drawing Trees with Perfect Angular Resolution and Polynomial Area,"We study methods for drawing trees with perfect angular resolution, i.e., with angles at each vertex, v, equal to $2pi /d(v)$. We show: 1.Any unordered tree has a crossing-free straight-line drawing with perfect angular resolution and polynomial area. 2. There are ordered trees that require exponential area for any crossing-free straight-line drawing having perfect angular resolution. 3. Any ordered tree has a crossing-free Lombardi-style drawing (where each edge is represented by a circular arc) with perfect angular resolution and polynomial area. Thus, our results explore what is achievable with straight-line drawings and what more is achievable with Lombardi-style drawings, with respect to drawings of trees with perfect angular resolution."
136,Hi-Tree Layout Using Quadratic Programming,"Horizontal placement of nodes in tree layout or layered drawings of directed graphs can be modelled as a convex quadratic program. Thus, quadratic programming provides a declarative framework for specifying such layouts which can then be solved optimally with a standard quadratic programming solver. While slower than specialized algorithms, the quadratic programming approach is fast enough for practical applications and has the great benefit of being flexible yet easy to implement with standard mathematical software. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by using it to layout hi-trees. These are a tree-like structure with compound nodes recently introduced for visualizing the logical structure of arguments and of decisions."
137,Drawing free trees,"Trees are models of various structures in computing and it is not surprising that considerable efforts have been made towards effective drawing algorithms for them. This paper discusses drawing algorithms for ""free trees"", that is, trees with no special root. The aim of these algorithms is to provide a drawing which satisfies several aesthetic criteria, such as avoiding edge crossings, minimizing variance in edge length, and keeping vertices a resonable distance apart. In this paper we measure the effectiveness of the algorithm presented by proving or disproving that they achieve such criteria."
138,Minimum size h-v drawings,"Trees are one of the most commonly used structures in computing, and many techniques for the visualization of trees are available. These techniques usually aim to find an aestetically pleasing layout for a tree on a screen of limited size. This paper presents an algorithm for ""h-v tree"" drawing. The algorithm can be used to find a drawing of minimal ""size"", where ""size"" has a variety of definitions (inclusing area). Two applications of the algorithm are explicitly presented."
139,Two Tree Drawing Conventions,"Rooted trees abound in computing and it is often necessary to draw them for visualization and documentation purposes. In the classical convention for tree drawing, the tree is drawn in a ""level"" fashion, with nodes (represented by boxes) at depth k lying on a horizontal line at a distance of k units below the root. The parent-child relationships are represented by lines between the boxes. Several algorithms have been developed for constructing a compact layout of a tree in the classical convention. In this paper we investigate algorithms for drawing trees according to two new conventions. In the inclusion convention, nodes are represented by boxes, and the parent-child relationship is represented by inclusion of one box in another. The tip-over convention again represents nodes as boxes, and, like the classical convention, represents the parent-child relationship by lines between the boxes; however, we allow siblings to be arranged vertically rather than horizontally. For many of the cases which arise in visualization of trees (for example, binary trees with textual information at the leaves) we present polynomial time algorithms. However, the general problem of finding minimum size layouts for either of the new conventions is shown to be NP-hard."
140,Visualizing the evolution of Web ecologies,"Several visualizations have emerged which attempt to visualize all or part of the World Wide Web. Those visualizations, however, fail to present the dynamically changing ecology of users and documents on the Web. We present new techniques for Web Ecology and Evolution Visualization (WEEV). Disk Trees represent a discrete time slice of the Web ecology. A collection of Disk Trees forms a Time Tube, representing the evolution of the Web over longer periods of time. These visualizations are intended to aid authors and webmasters with the production and organization of content, assist Web surfers making sense of information, and help researchers understand the Web."

142,BaobabView: Interactive construction and analysis of decision trees,"We present a system for the interactive construction and analysis of decision trees that enables domain experts to bring in domain specific knowledge. We identify different user tasks and corresponding requirements, and develop a system incorporating a tight integration of visualization, interaction and algorithmic support. Domain experts are supported in growing, pruning, optimizing and analysing decision trees. Furthermore, we present a scalable decision tree visualization optimized for exploration. We show the effectiveness of our approach by applying the methods to two use cases. The first case illustrates the advantages of interactive construction, the second case demonstrates the effectiveness of analysis of decision trees and exploration of the structure of the data."
143,Ordered and Unordered Treemap. Algorithms and Their Applications on Handheld Devices,"This thesis describes a way to visualize hierarchical structures on PDAs using Treemaps. A new ordered layout algorithm for treemaps, called Split Layout, is presented. Traditionally, treemap algorithms have exhibited a trade off between good aspect ratio and ordered layout. The new Split Layout is compared to five published treemap algorithms. Properties such as avarage aspect ratio, stability, run time and readability are measured, and it is shown that the new Split Layout performs better than any known ordered layout. The average aspect ratio is about 23% better and the stability increased between 28% and 40%. A user study was performed to measure the quality of the ordering of the new algorithm. 30 users gave a total of 360 measured response times, and it was found that the median time to locate a specific rectangle in the treemap only took 0.14 seconds (5%) longer for the Split Layout than for the Pivot by Split Size algorithm. The technique was implemented on a PDA and used for visualizing threaded discussion forums. User studies confirm that the concept on using treemaps on PDAs looks promising. The contents of the forum was easily grasped, even though the number of articles exceeded one hundred."
144,Structural Decomposition Trees,"Researchers and analysts in modern industrial and academic environments are faced with a daunting amount of multi-dimensional data. While there has been significant development in the areas of data mining and knowledge discovery, there is still the need for improved visualizations and generic solutions. The state-of-the-art in visual analytics and exploratory data visualization is to incorporate more profound analysis methods while focusing on fast interactive abilities. The common trend in these scenarios is to either visualize an abstraction of the data set or to better utilize screen-space. This paper presents a novel technique that combines clustering, dimension reduction and multi-dimensional data representation to form a multivariate data visualization that incorporates both detail and overview. This amalgamation counters the individual drawbacks of common projection and multi-dimensional data visualization techniques, namely ambiguity and clutter. A specific clustering criterion is used to decompose a multi-dimensional data set into a hierarchical tree structure. This decomposition is embedded in a novel Dimensional Anchor visualization through the use of a weighted linear dimension reduction technique. The resulting Structural Decomposition Tree (SDT) provides not only an insight of the data set's inherent structure, but also conveys detailed coordinate value information. Further, fast and intuitive interaction techniques are explored in order to guide the user in highlighting, brushing, and filtering of the data."

147,De ware geschiedenis van de Boom van Pythagoras,"The Pythagoras tree is a plane fractal constructed from squares. Invented by the Dutch mathematics teacher Albert E. Bosman in 1942, it is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras because each triple of touching squares encloses a right triangle, in a configuration traditionally used to depict the Pythagorean theorem."
148,ShamsehTrees: Providing Hierarchical Context for Nodes of Interest,"Visualizations of hierarchical data usually focus on conveying structure. However, with really large hierarchies, layouts tend to become overcrowded, making it difficult to see details about specific nodes. In contrast, ShamsehTrees focus on layouts centered on a node of interest, provide interactive nested layouts that were inspired by artistic and natural floral patterns, and make use of the natural symmetries in phyllotactic patterns. Instead of emphasizing overall tree structure, these layouts are created to make the most space available for the node of interest. The basic layout is comprised of nested circles that are centered on the node of interest. After selecting a new node of interest, the resizing and repositioning of nodes is animated as they transition to the new layout."
149,Symmetry and Node Focused Visualization of Large Trees,"In this paper, we take a different approach to visualizing very large trees. To facilitate presentation and exploration of massive hierarchical datasets such as linguistic and genealogical hierarchies, our approach considers drawing layouts of tree-cuts as a function of a node-of-interest or NOI, and uses interaction to support rapid access to the entire tree. Instead of emphasizing overall tree structure, our layout is designed to make the most space available for the node-of-interest and its immediate ancestors and descendants. Inspired from Persian floral patterns, we describe the development of ShamsehTree and PaisleyTree, showing how the use of symmetry can provide new structures for tree layouts."
150,PaisleyTrees: A Size-Invariant Tree Visualization,"Squeezing large tree structures into suitable visualizations has been a perennial problem. In response to this challenge, we present PaisleyTrees, a size-invariant tree visualization. PaisleyTrees integrate node-of-interest focus with tree-cut presentations to support rapid tree navigation without resorting to zooming and panning. This visualization offers the ability to work with trees of arbitrary depth and breadth, and maintains legibility for displayed elements. These advantages are achieved by using a hybrid layout, inspired by traditional Paisley patterns, that combines node-link, nested and djacency-based tree layout techniques, and offers both depth and breadth elision."
151,Visualization of Strandtexttrademark ~processes,"The paper describes a visualization tool that uses polar coordinates to create a circular shaped layout of large call trees of Strand programs. Due to the enormous amount of processes which are generated during execution of parallel Strand programs, conventional techniques to display call trees are over-charged. Because of this the tool `Polaranimation' was developed and implemented. One of its prominent features is the ability to display the complete call tree without loosing any vital information. Additionally, it provides debugging facilities and supports the performance tuning of parallel programs. A number of Strand programs have been written and a performance evaluation and comparison guided by `Polaranimation' was conducted."
152,Wordle,"Visualization is the graphic presentation of data -- portrayals meant to reveal complex information at a glance. Think of the familiar map of the New York City subway system, or a diagram of the human brain. Successful visualizations are beautiful not only for their aesthetic design, but also for elegant layers of detail that efficiently generate insight and new understanding. This book examines the methods of two dozen visualization experts who approach their projects from a variety of perspectives -- as artists, designers, commentators, scientists, analysts, statisticians, and more. Together they demonstrate how visualization can help us make sense of the world. Contributors include: Nick Bilton, Michael E. Driscoll, Jonathan Feinberg, Danyel Fisher, Jessica Hagy, Gregor Hochmuth, Todd Holloway, Noah Iliinsky, Eddie Jabbour, Valdean Klump, Aaron Koblin, Robert Kosara, Valdis Krebs, JoAnn Kuchera-Morin et al., Andrew Odewahn, Adam Perer, Anders Persson, Maximilian Schich, Matthias Shapiro, Julie Steele, Moritz Stefaner, Jer Thorp, Fernanda Viegas, Martin Wattenberg, and Michael Young."
153,Optimal Tree Layout (Preliminary Version),"We consider the problem of finding a minimal cost layout of a tree in Euclidian d-space. A tree is an acyclic undirected edge-weighted graph, and a layout is an assignment of a point in d-dimensional Euclidian space to each of the nodes of the tree. The ``length'' of an edge in the layout is the “distance” between its endpoints as measured by some norm. The cost of an edge is its length times its weight, and the cost of the whole layout is the sum of the costs of all the edges. We assume the positions of certain nodes are fixed in advance, and we wish to place the remaining nodes so as to minimize the cost of the layout."
154,ClockMap: Enhancing Circular Treemaps with Temporal Glyphs for Time-Series Data,"Treemaps are a powerful method to visualize especially time-invariant hierarchical data. Most attention is drawn to rectangular treemaps, because their space-filling layouts provide good scalability with respect to the amount of data that can be displayed. Since circular treemaps sacrifice the space-filling property and since higher level circles only approximately match the aggregated size of their descendants, they are rarely used in practice. However, for drawing circular glyphs their shape preserving property can outweigh these disadvantages and facilitate comparative tasks within and across hierarchy levels. The interactive ClockMap visualization effectively supports the user in exploring and finding patterns in hierarchical time-series data through drill-down, semantic zoom and details-on-demand. In this study, the technique's applicability is demonstrated on a real-world dataset about network traffic of a large computer network and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed in the context of alternative layouts."
155,RECIT: REpr'esentation Cartographique et Insulaire de Textes,"Experiences show that most readers are lost in electronic text, because they lack of global information. As a consequence, many people print electronic texts before reading them. This strange phenomenon was not predicted in the past and it could preclude the expansion of electronic reading. We propose here a way to provide some visualization of the structure of the document. That corresponds to the cartography of its overall organization. Our hope is that it could help to orient in electronic texts and consequently to facilitate electronic reading. This paper describes the origins of difficulties and then it presents all the technical details of the proposed solution."
156,AC$^3$ - Automatic Cartography of Cultural Contents,"Experiences with e-books show that the principle obstacle to electronic reading is neither the weight, nor the autonomy or the discomfort of reading on screen, but the absence of reference mark which makes it possible to replace the current window of reading in the whole of the book. We present an automatic cartography of electronic documents which constitutes an attempt to facilitate navigation, reading and memorization of contents. It is to automatically build a singular picture which is designed to be associated to our remembering of each document, i.e. to our mental image. This picture corresponds to the cartography of an island. Its shape is build from the document structure; its coloring reflects the affective content of the text extracted by keywords spotting techniques while icons associated to document topics are added to textual legends as in ancient geographical maps."
157,Memory Islands -- Ontology display,"With the concept of Memory Islands, the ACASA team propose a new tree visualization approach that is based on cartography, i.e. on a spatialization of abstract data structures, mainly trees. The hypothesis on which the notion Memory Island is based is that the spatialization helps to memorize contents. This notion of Memory Island is applied to ontology visualization, which could help to access to many online documents."

159,Planar Upward Tree Drawings with Planar Area,"Rooted trees are usually drawn planar and upward, i.e., without crossings and with-out any parent placed below its child. In this paper we investigate the area requirement of planar upward drawings of rooted trees. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the area of various types of drawings, and provide linear-time algorithms for constructing optimal area drawings. Let T be a bounded-degree rooted tree with N nodes. Our results are summarized as follows: We show that T admits a planar polyline upward grid drawing with area O(N), and with width O(N*alpha) for any prespecified constant a such that 0<alpha<1. If T is a binary tree, we show that T admits a planar orthogonal upward grid drawing with area O (N log log N). We show that if T is ordered, it admits an O(N log N)-area planar upward grid drawing that preserves the left-to-right ordering of the children of each node. We show that all of the above area bounds are asymptotically optimal in the worst case. We present O(N)-time algorithms for constructing each of the above types of drawings of T with asymptotically optimal area. We report on the experimentation of our algorithm for constructing planar polyline upward grid drawings, performed on trees with up to 24 million nodes."
160,Weighted Maps: Location-aware Treemaps,"The wide availability of quantitative geolocated structured data, e.g. census data, makes it desirable for classic tree visualizations to be location-aware. In this paper, we introduce a new treemap algorithm that produces rectangular cartograms consistently with the known location of data points on a geographic map."
161,Weighted Maps: Treemap visualization of geolocated quantitative data,"A wealth of census data relative to hierarchical administrative subdivisions are now available. It is therefore desirable for hierarchical data visualization techniques, to offer a spatially consistent representation of such data. This paper focuses on a widely used technique for hierarchical data, namely treemaps, with a particular emphasis on a specific family of treemaps, designed to take into account spatial constraints in the layout, called Spatially Dependent Treemap (SDT). The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we present the ``Weighted Maps'', a novel SDT layout algorithm and discuss the algorithmic differences with the other state-of-the-art SDT algorithms. Second, we present the quantitative results and analyses of a number of metrics that were used to assess the quality of the resulting layouts. The analyses are illustrated with figures generated from various datasets. Third, we show that the Weighted Maps algorithm offers a significant advantage for the layout of large flat cartograms and multilevel hierarchies having a large branching factor."
162,Drawing a Tree as a Minimum Spanning Tree Approximation,"We introduce and study (1+e)-EMST drawings, i.e. planar straight-line drawings of trees such that, for any fixed e>0, the distance between any two vertices is at least 1/1+e the length of the longest edge in the path connecting them. (1+e)-EMST drawings are good approximations of Euclidean minimum spanning trees. While it is known that only trees with bounded degree have a Euclidean minimum spanning tree realization, we show that every tree T has a (1+e)-EMST drawing for any given e>0. We also present drawing algorithms that compute (1+e)-EMST drawings of trees with bounded degree in polynomial area. As a byproduct of one of our techniques, we improve the best known area upper bound for Euclidean minimum spanning tree realizations of complete binary trees."

164,Bubble Treemaps for Uncertainty Visualization,"We present a novel type of circular treemap, where we intentionally allocate extra space for additional visual variables. With this extended visual design space, we encode hierarchically structured data along with their uncertainties in a combined diagram. We introduce a hierarchical and force-based circle-packing algorithm to compute Bubble Treemaps, where each node is visualized using nested contour arcs. Bubble Treemaps do not require any color or shading, which offers additional design choices. We explore uncertainty visualization as an application of our treemaps using standard error and Monte Carlo-based statistical models. To this end, we discuss how uncertainty propagates within hierarchies. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of our visualization using three different examples: the package structure of Flare, the S&P 500 index, and the US consumer expenditure survey."
165,Embedding Tree Structures in VLSI Hexagonal Arrays,"Tree structures have been proposed for special-purpose and general-purpose multiprocessors due to their desirable property of logarithmic path from the root to any leaf element. Since only local communication among processors is needed in tree structures, they are well suited for the VLSI technology. Such an implementation requires an area-economical mapping of a tree on a plane. Novel mapping schemes for trees onto hexagonal arrays (or grids) and appropriate algorithms are proposed here and shown to be superior over known mappings on square arrays (or grids)."
166,Efficient Embeddings of Binary Trees in VLSI Arrays,"We consider the problem of embedding a complete binary tree in squareor hexagonally-connected VLSI arrays Of processing elements (PE's). This problem can be solved in a radically different manner from current layout techniques which are aimed at laying out a given graph in the plane. The difference is due to the fact that a PE can be used both as a tree node and as a connecting element between distant nodes. New embedding schemes are presented in which (asymptotically) 100 percent of the PE's are utilized as tree nodes. This is a significant savings over known schemes, which achieve 50 percent utilization (the well-known H-tree) and 71 percent for some hexagonal schemes. These schemes also speed up signal propagation from the root to the leaves."
167,Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps: A Visualization Technique for Time-Varying Hierarchical Data,"Treemaps are a widely used technique for the visualization of hierarchical data. In general, these techniques perform a space-filling recursive subdivision of a 2D space where the sizes of the created regions correspond to values of a particular data attribute. Several subdivision algorithms have been proposed to optimize specific criteria, such as region aspect ratio or stability. However, these goals are often contradictory. For example, existing layout algorithms that optimize for aspect ratio -- important for legibility -- are typically not stable. For this reason, Treemaps are rarely used in animated displays of time-variant data. When they are applied to dynamic data sets, unstable Treemap layout algorithms produce poorly animated transitions that include discontinuous jumps in region position when values change. This paper introduces a new technique called Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps. Our layout algorithm is specifically designed to support smooth, real-time animation of time varying hierarchical data while maintaining desirable aspect ratios. We describe our novel approach and outline how it overcomes key limitations of prior Voronoi-based Treemap work to enable the visualization of dynamic data. Results from an evaluation study of the technique are provided along with a brief use case highlighting a real-world application of Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps."
168,"Evaluating a System for Interactive Exploration of Large, Hierarchically Structured Document Repositories","The InfoSky visual explorer is a system enabling users to interactively explore large, hierarchically structured document collections. Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. Documents of similar content are placed close to each other and displayed as stars, while collections of documents at a particular level in the hierarchy are visualised as bounding polygons. Usability testing of an early prototype implementation of InfoSky revealed several design issues which prevented users from fully exploiting the power of the visual metaphor. Evaluation results have been incorporated into an advanced prototype, and another usability test has been conducted. A comparison of test results demonstrates enhanced system performance and points out promising directions for further work."
169,Unit-length embedding of binary trees on a square grid,"We give a proof of the fact that determining whether or not a given binary tree has a grid embedding with edges of unit length is an NP-complete problem. The proof follows an idea indicated by Bhatt and Cosmadakis in [1], which has been implemented using a new building block called U-tree."
170,Bubble Tree Drawing Algorithm,"In this paper, we present an algorithm, called Bubble Tree, for the drawing of general rooted trees. A large variety of algorithms already exists in this field. However, the goal of this algorithm is to obtain a better drawing which makes a trade off between the angular resolution and the length of the edges. We show that the Bubble Tree drawing algorithm provides a planar drawing with at most one bend per edge in linear running time."
171,Visualization of attributed hierarchical structures in a spatiotemporal context,"When visualizing data, spatial and temporal references of these data often have to be considered in addition to the actual data attributes. Nowadays, structural information is becoming more and more important. Hierarchies, for instance, are frequently applied to make large and complex data manageable. Hence, a visual depiction of hierarchical structures in space and time is required. While there are several techniques addressing specific aspects of spatiotemporal visualization, approaches that cope with space, time, data, and structure are rare. With this paper we take a step to fill this gap. By combining various well-established concepts we achieve a reasonably complete visualization of all of the aforementioned aspects, where our focus is on hierarchical structures. We embed hierarchies directly into regions of a map display using variants of the point-based layout. Layering and animation are applied to visualize temporal aspects. Depending on analysis goals, users can switch between representations that emphasize data attributes or hierarchical structures. Interaction techniques support users in navigating the data and their visualization. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by adapting it to implement a visualization for spatio-temporal human health data."
172,Visualization of Varying Hierarchies by Stable Layout of Voronoi Treemaps,"Space-restricted techniques for visualizing hierarchies generally achieve high scalability and readability (e.g., tree maps, bundle views, sunburst). However, the visualization layout directly depends on the hierarchy, that is, small changes to the hierarchy can cause wide-ranging changes to the layout. For this reason, it is difficult to use these techniques to compare similar variants of a hierarchy because users are confronted with layouts that do not expose the expected similarity. Voronoi treemaps appear to be promising candidates to overcome this limitation. However, existing Voronoi treemap algorithms do not provide deterministic layouts or assume a fixed hierarchy. In this paper we present an extended layout algorithm for Voronoi treemaps that provides a high degree of layout similiarity for varying hierarchies, such as software-system hierarchies. The implementation uses a deterministic initial-distribution approach that reduces the variation in node positioning even if changes in the underlying hierarchy data occur. Compared to existing layout algorithms, our algorithm achieves lower error rates with respect to node areas in the case of weighted Voronoi diagrams, which we show in a comparative study."
173,Hybrid-Treemap Layouting,"This paper presents an approach for hybrid treemaps, which applies and combines several different layout principles within a single tree map in contrast to traditional treemap variants based on a single layout concept. To this end, we analyze shortcomings of state-of-the-art treemap algorithms such as Moore, Voronoi and Strip layouts. Based on a number of identified edge cases, we propose a combination of these different layout algorithms, individually selected for and applied on each sub hierarchy of the given treemap data. The selection decision is based on the number of items to be layouted as well as the aspect ratio of the containing visual elements. Futhermore, a layout quality score based on existing treemap layout metrics (e.g., average distance change, relative direction change, average aspect ratio) has been used to evaluate the results of the proposed hybrid layout algorithm and to demonstrate its usefulness applied on representative hierarchical data sets."
174,Large tree structure visualization and display system,"System for the visualization of a large tree structure in which the selection of a center object (40) amongst the objects of the large tree structure enables n levels of descendants from the center object to be visualized on a screen together with the center object, the system has a visualization control in computer memory enabling the objects of a given level corresponding to the children of a parent object of the immediate higher level to be visualized in a fan-shaped area centered around the parent object. A scrollbar associated with the parent object enables all the children of a parent object to be scrolled in a fan. Fan control buttons on the screen enable the aperture of the fans to be modified so that a variable number of children can be visualized in each fan."
175,Beamtrees: Compact Visualization of Large Hierarchies,"Beamtrees are a new method for the visualization of large hierarchical data sets. Nodes are shown as stacked circular beams, such that both the hierarchical structure as well as the size of nodes are depicted. The dimensions of beams are calculated using a variation of the treemap algorithm. A small user study indicated that beamtrees are significantly more effective than nested treemaps and cushion treemaps for the extraction of global hierarchical information."
176,RELT -- Visualizing Trees on Mobile Devices,"The small screens on increasingly used mobile devices challenge the traditional visualization methods designed for desktops. This paper presents a method called ""Radial Edgeless Tree"" (RELT) for visualizing trees in a 2-dimensional space. It combines the existing connection tree drawing with the space-filling approach to achieve the efficient display of trees in a small geometrical area, such as the screen that are commonly used in mobile devices. We recursively calculate a set of non-overlapped polygonal nodes that are adjacent in the hierarchical manner. Thus, the display space is fully used for displaying nodes, while the hierarchical relationships among the nodes are presented by the adjacency (or boundary-sharing) of the nodes. It is different from the other traditional connection approaches that use a node-link diagram to present the parent-child relationships which waste the display space. The hierarchy spreads from north-west to south-east in a top-down manner which naturally follows the traditional way of human perception of hierarchies. We discuss the characteristics, advantages and limitations of this new technique and suggestions for future research."
177,A Mobile Interface for Hierarchical Information Visualization and Navigation,"There is a dramatic increase in the population who use mobile computing devices. Though the hardware becomes more powerful, effective support for information rendering on small screens very much lags behind. To display hierarchical information, researchers have proposed many algorithms for desktop screen visualization. Such algorithms are generally divided into connection and enclosure. Connection approach displays hierarchy with a clear structure but consume display area. Enclosure can maximally utilize the screen space but the layout is essentially implicit. This paper describes a new Radial Edgeless Tree (RELT) for visualizing hierarchical data on palm sized devices. The aim of RELT is to combine the advantages of connection and enclosure approaches. By recursively partitioning the display area, this technique maximizes the space usage. The structural clarity of layout can be reached by arranging location of non-overlapping regions. RELT can be adapted for visualizing structural information for various applications."
178,Managing Hierarchical Information on Small Screens,"This paper presents a visualization methodology called Radial Edgeless Tree (RELT) for visualizing and navigating hierarchical information on mobile interfaces. RELT is characterized by recursive division of a polygonal display area, space-filling, maximum screen space usage, and clarity of the hierarchical structure. It is also general and flexible enough to allow users to customize the root location and stylize the layout. The paper presents the general RELT drawing algorithm that is adaptable and customizable for different applications. We demonstrate the algorithm's application for stock market visualization, and also present an empirical study on an emulated implementation with a currently used cell phone interface in terms of their performances in finding desired information."
179,Visualizing and Navigating Hierarchical Information on Mobile User Interfaces,"This paper presents a visualization approach called Radial Edgeless Tree (RELT) for visualizing and navigating hierarchical information on small screens. Major advantages of the RELT approach include: elegance recursive division of the display area, space-filling, maximum usage of screen estate, and clarity of the hierarchical structure. It offers the flexibility such that users can customize the hierarchy's root location and stylize the layout. The RELT drawing algorithm is adaptable and customizable for different application domains. We have implemented the RELT interface on the Google Android emulator. The paper presents the Android implementation, and then provides an analytical and empirical comparison of the Android implementation with a traditional cell phone interface in terms of their performances in navigating hierarchical information."

182,A linear algorithm for compact box-drawings of trees,"In a box-drawing of a rooted tree, each node is drawn by a rectangular box of prescribed size, no two boxes overlap each other, all boxes corresponding to siblings of the tree have the same x-coordinate at their left sides, and a parent node is drawn at a given distance apart from its first child. A box drawing of a tree is compact if it attains the minimum possible rectangular area enclosing the drawing. We give a linear-time algorithm for finding a compact box-drawing of a tree. A known algorithm does not always find a compact box-drawing and takes time $O(n^2)$ if a tree has n nodes."

184,A novel method for large tree visualization,"Many genomic and proteomic analyses generate as a result a tree of genes or proteins. These trees are often large (containing tens of thousands of nodes and edges), and need a visualization tool to fully display all the information contained in the tree. Clustering analysis can be performed on these trees to obtain clusters of proteins, and we need an efficient way to visualize the clustering results. We present a novel tree visualization tool to help with such analyses."
185,"DOITrees Revisited: Scalable, Space-Constrained Visualization of Hierarchical Data","This paper extends previous work on focus+context visualizations of tree-structured data, introducing an efficient, space-constrained, multi-focal tree layout algorithm (TreeBlock) and techniques at both the system and interactive levels for dealing with scale. These contributions are realized in a new version of the Degree-Of-Interest Tree browser, supporting real-time interactive visualization and exploration of data sets containing on the order of a million nodes."

187,Drawing Contour Trees in the Plane,"The contour tree compactly describes scalar field topology. From the viewpoint of graph drawing, it is a tree with attributes at vertices and optionally on edges. Standard tree drawing algorithms emphasize structural properties of the tree and neglect the attributes. Applying known techniques to convey this information proves hard and sometimes even impossible. We present several adaptions of popular graph drawing approaches to the problem of contour tree drawing and evaluate them. We identify five aesthetic criteria for drawing contour trees and present a novel algorithm for drawing contour trees in the plane that satisfies four of these criteria. Our implementation is fast and effective for contour tree sizes usually used in interactive systems (around 100 branches) and also produces readable pictures for larger trees, as is shown for a $sim 800$ branch example."
188,Skeletal images as visual cues in graph visualization,"The problem of graph layout and drawing is fundamental to many aproaches to the visualization of relational information structures. As the data set grows, the visualization problem is compounded by the need to reconcile the user's need for orientation cues with the danger of information overload. Put simply: How can we limit the number of visual elements on the screen so as not to overwhelm the user yet retain enough information that the user is able to navigate and explore the data set confidently? How can we provide orientational cues so that a user can understand the location of the current viewpoint in a large data set? These are problems inherent not only to graph drawing but information visualization in general. We propose a method which extracts the significant features of a directed acyclic graph as the basis for navigation"
189,Latour -- A Tree Visualisation System,"This paper presents some of the most important features of a tree visualisation system called Latour, developed for the purposes of information visualisation. This system includes a number of interesting and unique characteristics, for example the provision for visual cues based on complexity metrics on graphs, which represent general principles that, in our view, graph based information visualisation systems should generally offer."
190,Graph Visualization and Navigation in Information Visualization: A Survey,"This is a survey on graph visualization and navigation techniques, as used in information visualization. Graphs appear in numerous applications such as Web browsing, state-transition diagrams, and data structures. The ability to visualize and to navigate in these potentially large, abstract graphs is often a crucial part of an application. Information visualization has specific requirements, which means that this survey approaches the results of traditional graph drawing from a different perspective."
191,Embeddings of complete binary trees into extended grids with edge-congestion 1,"Let G and H be two simple, undirected graphs. An embedding of the graph G into the graph H is an injective mapping f from the vertices of G to the vertices of H, together with a mapping which assigns to each edge [u, v] of G a path between f (u) and f (v) in H. The extended grid EM(r, s) is the graph whose vertex set is the set of pairs on nonnegative integers, (i, j) : 0 <= i < r, 0 <= j < s, in which there is an edge between vertices (i, j) and (k, l) if and only if |I - k| <= 1 and |j - l| <= 1. In this paper, we give an embedding of any complete binary tree of odd height into its optimal square extended grid. This embedding has edge-congestion 1, dilation 2^(n-2) + 1, and its average dilation is less than 1.12. We also show that an embedding of a complete binary tree of odd height into its optimal grid, which is obtained from the embedding into the optimal extended grid by a simple transformation, has edge-congestion 2, dilation 2^(n-1), and it creates in the grid far fewer edges of congestion 2 than the embedding from Zienicke (1990)."
192,Tree visualization system and method based upon a compressed half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry,"A node-link structure is displayed within a display area, having a narrow rectangular shape with an edge along one side acting as a horizon of a hyperbolic space half-plane. Lower level node features that share a parent node feature have centers of area positioned on the display in order along a line parallel with the horizon, with sufficiently similar spacings along an axis perpendicular to the horizon from the region around a parent node feature, and with sufficiently similar spacings in a dimension parallel to the horizon from adjacent node features along the line, that the lower level node features sharing the parent node feature are perceptible as a group of related node features. The half-plane model with compression is used for layout of the node-link data, and the hyperbolic layout data is mapped to a Euclidean space for display."
193,Bubble Hierarchies,"We introduce bubble hierarchies as an approach to generating algorithmic art from random hierarchies. The technique is based on repeatedly drawing color-coded circles to illustrate parent--child relationships. The algorithm is simple and produces densely packed structures similar to the concept of Apollonian gaskets. We demonstrate the influence of different parameters on the visual outcome, such as the number of created circles or the color encoding. Our algorithm also supports multiple seeding points and obstacles that can be used to influence the layout of the hierarchy."
194,Visual Realism for the Visualization of Software Metrics,"The visualization techniques used in current software visualization frameworks make use of a limited set of graphical elements to highlight relevant aspects of a software system. Typical examples of such elements are text, simple geometric shapes and uniform color fills. Although human visual perception enables rapid processing of additional visual cues like shading and texture, they are not used. We contend that such 2D and 3D computer graphics techniques for achieving visual realism can be used to increase the information throughput of software visualization techniques. Visualization results are presented to show how treemaps, cushions, color, texture, and bump mapping can be used to visualize software metrics of hierarchically organized elements of a software system"
195,PolyPlane: An Implementation of a New Layout Algorithm For Trees In Three Dimensions,
196,Drawing Trees Symmetrically in Three Dimensions,"Symmetric graph drawing enables a clear understanding of the structure of the graph. Previous work on symmetric graph drawing has focused on two dimensions. Symmetry in three dimensions is much richer than that of two dimensions. This is the first paper to extend symmetric graph drawing into three dimensions. More specifically, the paper investigates the problem of drawing trees symmetrically in three dimensions. First, we suggest a model for drawing trees symmetrically in three dimensions. Based on this model, we present a linear time algorithm for finding the maximum number of three-dimensional symmetries in trees. We also present a three-dimensional symmetric drawing algorithm for trees."
197,Visualizing Biodiversity with Voronoi Treemaps,"Introduced in 2005, the Voronoi treemap algorithm is an information visualization technique for displaying hierarchical data. Voronoi treemaps use weighted, centroidal Voronoi diagrams to create a nested tessellation of convex polygons. However, despite appealing qualities, few real world examples of Voronoi treemaps exist. In this paper, we present a multi-touch tabletop application called Involv that uses the Voronoi treemap algorithm to create an interactive visualization for the Encyclopedia of Life. Involv is the result of a year-long iterative development process and includes over 1.2 million named species organized in a nine-level hierarchy. Working in the domain of life sciences, we have encountered the need to display supplemental hierarchical data to augment information in the treemap. Thus we propose an extension of the Voronoi treemap algorithm that employs force-directed graph drawing techniques both to guide the construction of the treemap and to overlay a supplemental hierarchy."
198,The Binary Tree as an Interconnection Network: Applications to Multiprocessor Systems and VLSI,"The binary tree is a natural way to organize complex computations by a computer. For problems that can be naturally divided into a tree structure, a great deal of parallelism may be employed. In this paper we examine several aspects of the binary tree structure as it relates to both multiprocessor systems and to VISI circuit design. First, we present an algorithm for mapping an arbitrary binary tree onto the plane. An analysis shows the density of this mapping. Second, we consider the problem of routing messages within a binary tree under the assumption that certain nodes may be faulty. Finally, we analyze the binary tree's capacity to transfer information between nodes and we compare it to the capacity of the linear array and the grid."
199,Three-Dimensional EncCon Tree,"This paper describes a three-dimensional extension of a enclosure+connection layout technique, called EncCon tree. The three-dimensional visualization includes layout and navigation. The layout algorithm directly generalizes the two-dimensional EncCon tree layout algorithm to three-dimensional space in which nodes at the same level of the hierarchy are placed onto the same plane. The interactive navigation uses standard three-dimensional viewing techniques which include view transformation, rotation and zoom."
200,Creating Visual Browsers for Large-Scale Online Auctions,"This chapter discusses the requirements raised for running online auctions as well as the technical issues on the design of graphical user interfaces and how we could use these graphical interfaces to help users navigate visualization technique called EncCon as well as the design of graphic attributes that can be used to present the domain specific attributes of the auction items and the relational structures among these items, and these graphic presentations will provide users with a clear map showing the possible paths to the target items. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by illustrating an online auction prototype that simulates the ordinary auction activities with the assistance of visualization."
201,TreemapBar: Visualizing Additional Dimensions of Data in Bar Chart,"Bar chart is a very common and simple graph that is mainly used to visualize simple x, y plots of data for numerical comparisons by partitioning the categorical data values into bars and typically limited to operate on highly aggregated dataset. In today's growing complexity of business data with multi dimensional attributes using bar chart itself is not sufficient to deal with the representation of such business dataset and it also not utilizes the screen space efficiently.Nevertheless, bar chart is still useful because of its shape create strong visual attention to users at first glance than other visualization techniques. In this article, we present a treemap bar chart + tablelens interaction technique that combines the treemap and bar chart visualizations with a tablelens based zooming technique that allows users to view the detail of a particular bar when the density of bars increases. In our approach, the capability of the original bar chart and treemaps for representing complex business data is enhanced and the utilization of display space is also optimized."
202,Degree-of-Interest Visualization for Ontology Exploration,"In recent years, improvements in semantic web technologies have given us new expressive description languages for modeling knowledge domains — the so called ontologies. Nevertheless, ontology editors lack of easy and intuitive user interfaces, so that the exploration and creation of ontologies is often too difficult to be efficient. In this short paper, we introduce a new tree widget which utilizes sophisticated visualization and interaction features for ontology exploration and editing as a work in progress study. Due to space limitations we co+ncentrate here on the aspect of ontology browsing."
203,Human perception of structure in shaded space-filling visualizations,"Very early in the object recognition process the human visual system extracts shading information. While shading can enhance the visibility of structures, it can have a negative impact on the judgment of sizes of elements in a structure. In certain visualization systems the underlying hierarchical structure is not noticeably explicit, such as in space-filling techniques. We hypothesize that in such cases, shading can make the structure more explicit. In this paper, we report the results of two experiments designed to investigate the effects of shading information on extracting the structure in space-filling visualizations. In the first experiment subjects performed better with the visualization tool with shading on structure-based tasks. Our results do not show that shading impairs users' judgment on size-based tasks. A subjective evaluation shows that users preferred interacting with the system when shading was available. The second experiment was designed to investigate further users' capacity to identify structural elements within the space-filling visualization. A substructure recognition task was employed in this experiment and results show that users are capable of identifying sub-structures quicker and with fewer errors when the visualization tool was equipped with shading information than without. The results of both experiments provide evidence that shading information can be used to effectively obtain structural information from space-filling visualizations."
204,Ripple Presentation for Tree Structures with Historical Information,"We propose a new method for representing tree structures with historical information. We call this method Ripple Presentation. Categories of nodes are represented by the angles of edges and elapsed time is represented by the length of the edges. In this way, the method can express both the time series and categories, which has been diffic lt to achieve with either tree structures or lists. As a result, users can nderstand the overall information from their viewpoint view and discover target information effectively. We applied the method to trackback links of Weblog articles and the latest articles of News sites using RSS on Web as a resource."
205,Data Jewelry Box: A Graphics Showcase for Large-Scale Hierarchical Data Visualization,"We see many kinds of large-scale hierarchical data in our daily lives, such as file systems of computers, company organizations, and category-based Web search sites such as Yahoo. Most of the GUIs for these data sources first represent a higher level of the data, and provide an interface so that users can select an interesting portion of the data and locally explore the lower levels. On the other hand, there are not many visualization techniques that give an overview of the data by placing all of the lower-level data onto a display region. How can we implement such a technique that represents all the data in one display, just like the showcases of a jewelry store displays all the jewels in the shop? That is the motivation of this research. The report presents a visualization technique that places all of the lowest-level portions of a hierarchical data set on a display space. It first groups icons that denote the lowest-level data, and then generates rectangles that enclose each group of icons. It repeats the process of generating rectangles that enclose the lower-level rectangles, until the highest-level rectangles are enclosed by the largest rectangle. To use the display space most reasonably, our technique efficiently searches for gaps where rectangles can be located without overlapping adjacent rectangles. We use Delaunay triangular meshes that connect the centers of the rectangles to quickly find the gaps."
206,HeiankyoView: Orthogonal Representation of Large-scale Hierarchical Data,"Visualization is very useful for various large-scale computing fields. One of the authors has reported a hierarchical data visualization technique, and applied it to various large-scale computing data including large-scale Web sites, but also for data mining results, Web search queries, network intrusion detection results, and distributed processes. This paper presents the new hierarchical data visualization technique, HeiankyoView, which can be also applied to various large-scale computing fields. It places data items of input data while it packs the items as many as possible in small display areas, and aligns the items along X-axis and Y-axis of the display area. The technique represents nodes of hierarchical data as a set of rectangles, which are parallel to X-axis and Y-axis. Here the technique orthogonally divides the display area by extension lines of edges of previously placed rectangles. By referring the grid-like subspaces of the display area, the technique quickly finds the adequate positions to place remaining rectangles."
207,Hierarchical Data Visualization Using a Fast Rectangle-Packing Algorithm,We present a technique for the representation of large-scale hierarchical data which aims to provide good overviews of complete structures and the content of the data in one display space. The technique represents the data by using nested rectangles. It first packs icons or thumbnails of the lowest-level data and then generates rectangular borders that enclose the packed data. It repeats the process of generating rectangles that enclose the lower-level rectangles until the highest-level rectangles are packed. We present two rectangle-packing algorithms for placing items of hierarchical data onto display spaces. The algorithms refer to Delaunay triangular meshes connecting the centers of rectangles to find gaps where rectangles can be placed. The first algorithm places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the extension of the layout area is minimal. The second algorithm places rectangles by referring to templates describing the ideal positions for nodes of input data. It places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the combination of the layout area and the distances between the positions described in the template and the actual positions is minimal. It can smoothly represent time-varying data by referring to templates that describe previous layout results. It is also suitable for semantics-based or design-based data layout by generating templates according to the semantics or design.
208,Reconfigurable Disc Trees for Visualizing Large Hierarchical Information Space,"We present a new visualization technique, called RDT (Reconfigurable Disc Tree) which can alleviate the disadvantages of cone trees significantly for large hierarchies while maintaining its context of using 3D depth. In RDT, each node is associated with a disc around which its children are placed. Using discs instead of cones as the basic shape in RDT has several advantages: significant reduction of occluded region, sharp increase in number of displayed nodes, and easy projection onto plane without visual overlapping. We show that RDT can greatly enhance user perception by transforming its shapes dynamically in several ways:(1) disc tree which can significantly reduce the occluded region by the foreground objects, (2) compact disc tree which can increase the number of nodes displayed on the screen, and (3) plane disc tree which can be mapped onto the plane without visual overlapping. We describe an implementation of our visualization system called VISIT (Visual Information System for reconfigurable dIsc Tree). It provides 2D and 3D layouts for RDT and various user interface features such as tree reconfiguration, tree transformation, tree shading, viewing transformation, animation, selection and browsing which can enhance the user perception and navigation capabilities. We also evaluate our system using the following three metrics: percentage of occlusion, density of displayed nodes on a screen. number of identifiable nodes."
209,Drawing Trees: How Many Circles to Use?,"In this paper, we proposed a new approach for drawing rooted trees on circles. Previous approaches either draw entire tree on a single circle or draw too many circles that every node and its children are on a new circle. As a result, they only work well on limited kinds of trees. In contrary, our approach adaptively choose how many circles to use based on a single user input and it can be generalized well to all kinds of trees. Our approach has three phases. First, we recursively divide the tree into a hierarchy of subtrees according to the user input. The subtrees are then processed from bottom to top of the hierarchy and each of them is drawn around a separated circle. Finally, layout of subtrees are assembled together to form the layout of the entire tree. Comparing to previous methods, our approach obtains both compact and pleasing tree drawings with less bends. Furthermore, our method naturally supports visualization interactions, such as locally zooming in/out, when user navigates the drawings. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
210,MetNetGE: Visualizing Biological Networks in Hierarchical Views and 3D Tiered Layouts,"Linking experimental data with large-scale biomedical networks is key for achieving new discoveries in system biology research. Visualization tools that facilitate these tasks often result in a dense Web of connections that resembles a tangled hairball and is difficult to interpret. MetNetGE is an interactive pathway navigation tool based on Google Earth that features novel visualization techniques for pathway information display. Instead of simply showing all the pathways in a network in a complex graph, MetNetGE visualizes the entire network of pathways based on the hierarchical pathway ontology using a novel radial space filling (RSF) method. Orbits show when pathways belong to multiple categories. Mapping cumulative experiment statistics on the RSF drawing aids biologists in easily identifying highly activated pathways in an experiment. After identifying key pathways, biologists can fly to the corresponding region and see the detailed pathway and experimental data in an aligned 3D tiered layout with simplified cross-layer connection patterns."
211,Visualizing Multivariate Hierarchic Data Using Enhanced Radial Space-Filling Layout,"Currently, visualization tools for large ontologies (e.g., pathway and gene ontologies) result in a very flat wide tree that is difficult to fit on a single display. This paper develops the concept of using an enhanced radial space-filling (ERSF) layout to show biological ontologies efficiently. The ERSF technique represents ontology terms as circular regions in 3D. Orbital connections in a third dimension correspond to non-tree edges in the ontology that exist when an ontology term belongs to multiple categories. Biologists can use the ERSF layout to identify highly activated pathway or gene ontology categories by mapping experimental statistics such as coefficient of variation and overrepresentation values onto the visualization. This paper illustrates the use of the ERSF layout to explore pathway and gene ontologies using a gene expression dataset from E. coli."
212,MetNetGE: interactive views of biological networks and ontologies,"Linking high-throughput experimental data with biological networks is a key step for understanding complex biological systems. Currently, visualization tools for large metabolic networks often result in a dense web of connections that is difficult to interpret biologically. The MetNetGE application organizes and visualizes biological networks in a meaningful way to improve performance and biological interpretability. MetNetGE is an interactive visualization tool based on the Google Earth platform. MetNetGE features novel visualization techniques for pathway and ontology information display. Instead of simply showing hundreds of pathways in a complex graph, MetNetGE gives an overview of the network using the hierarchical pathway ontology using a novel layout, called the Enhanced Radial Space-Filling (ERSF) approach that allows the network to be summarized compactly. The non-tree edges in the pathway or gene ontology, which represent pathways or genes that belong to multiple categories, are linked using orbital connections in a third dimension. Biologists can easily identify highly activated pathways or gene ontology categories by mapping of summary experiment statistics such as coefficient of variation and overrepresentation values onto the visualization. After identifying such pathways, biologists can focus on the corresponding region to explore detailed pathway structure and experimental data in an aligned 3D tiered layout. In this paper, the use of MetNetGE is illustrated with pathway diagrams and data from E. coli and Arabidopsis. MetNetGE is a visualization tool that organizes biological networks according to a hierarchical ontology structure. The ERSF technique assigns attributes in 3D space, such as color, height, and transparency, to any ontological structure. For hierarchical data, the novel ERSF layout enables the user to identify pathways or categories that are differentially regulated in particular experiments. MetNetGE also displays complex biological pathway in an aligned 3D tiered layout for exploration."
213,Tree-Maps: A space-filling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures,"A method for visualizing hierarchically structured information is described. The tree-map visualization technique makes 100% use of the available display space, mapping the full hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner. This efficient use of space allows very large hierarchies to be displayed in their entirety and facilitates the presentation of semantic information. Tree-maps can depict both the structure and content of the hierarchy. However, the approach is best suited to hierarchies in which the content of the leaf nodes and the structure of the hierarchy are of primary importance, and the content information associated with internal nodes is largely derived from their children."
214,TreeViz: Treemap visualization of hierarchically structured information,"TreeViz is an Apple Macintosh implementation of the treemap technique for visualizing hierarchical information structures. TreeViz enables users to visualize and browse large hierarchically structured information spaces. TreeViz enables the drawing of hierarchies an order of magnitude larger (number of nodes) than is possible with typical presentation methods, given the same display space."
215,Treemaps: Visualizing hierarchical and categorical data,"Treemaps are a graphically based method for the visualization of hierarchical or categorical data spaces. Treemap presentations of data shift mental workload from the cognitive to the perceptual systems, taking advantage of the human visual processing system to increase the bandwidth of the human-computer interface. Efficient use of display space allows for the simultaneous presentation of thousands of data records, as well as facilitating the presentation of semantic information. Treemaps let users see the forest and the trees by providing local detail in the context of a global overview, providing a visually engaging environment in which to analyze, search, explore and manipulate large hierarchical and categorical data spaces. The treemap method of hierarchical visualization, at its core, is based on the property of containment. This property of containment is a fundamental idea which powerfully encapsulates many of our reasons for constructing information hierarchies. All members of the treemap family of algorithms partition multi-dimensional display spaces based on weighted hierarchical data sets. In addition to generating treemaps and standard traditional hierarchical diagrams, the treemap algorithms extend non-hierarchical techniques such as bar and pie charts into the domain of hierarchical presentation. Treemap algorithms can be used to generate bar charts, outlines, traditional 2-D node and link diagrams, pie charts, cone trees, cam trees, drum trees, etc. Generating existing diagrams via treemap transformations is an excercise meant to show the power, ease, and generality with which alternative presentations can be generated from the basic treemap algorithms. Controlled experiments with novice treemap users and real data highlight the strengths of treemaps and provide direction for improvement. Experimental results show that treemaps are a powerful visualization tool for large data sets, significantly reducing user performance times for global comparison tasks. Effective visualizations of large data sets can help users gain insight into relevant features of the data, construct accurate mental models of the information, and locate regions of particular interest. Treemaps are based on simple, fundamental ideas, but they are the building blocks with which an entire world of unique and exciting visualizations can be built."
216,Application of Helix Cone Tree Visualizations to Dynamic Call Graph Illustration,"We describe a tool that enables users to record and visualise runtime behaviour of software applications developed in Java. The execution trace, stored in the form of an XML file is visualized using 3D call graphs that are an extension of the Cone Tree information visualisation technique. This tool gives the user the ability to create several call graph views from a program's execution trace, providing additional representations of the program execution to both novice and expert programmers for the purposes of program execution analysis."
217,Visualization of mappings between the gene ontology and cluster trees,"Ontologies and hierarchical clustering are both important tools in biology and medicine to study high-throughput data such as transcriptomics and metabolomics data. Enrichment of ontology terms in the data is used to identify statistically overrepresented ontology terms, giving insight into relevant biological processes or functional modules. Hierarchical clustering is a standard method to analyze and visualize data to find relatively homogeneous clusters of experimental data points. Both methods support the analysis of the same data set, but are usually considered independently. However, often a combined view is desired: visualizing a large data set in the context of an ontology under consideration of a clustering of the data. This paper proposes a new visualization method for this task."

219,Visualization of Complex Structures on Mobile Handhelds,"Information Visualization has become an important research topic in Computer Graphics. One key issue of this topic is the visual presentation of intrinsic structures of complex information spaces. Today nearly all approaches of structure visualization are designed for none-mobile devices such as PCs or workstations. However, mobile handhelds have become more popular in recent years, and are increasingly used in different application domains. Limited resources of these devices require new paradigms for information presentation and interaction such as new methods for structure visualization based on new metaphors for efficient screen space usage. This paper describes how recent techniques of structure visualization can be adapted or redesigned for mobile pocket-sized devices."
220,Generating an Outside-in Hierarchical Tree Visualization,"A data visualization tool (``tool'') configured to generate a visualization for tree data. The tool can calculate a number of hierarchical levels of the tree data. The tool can further subdivide a presentation area for the data visualization into a number of concentric parts. The concentric parts are equivalent to the number of hierarchical levels. Each of the concentric parts corresponds to one of the hierarchical levels. Further, the tool can graphically generate the data visualization for presentation via an electronic display. A first of the concentric parts that corresponds to a highest of the hierarchal levels is an outermost one of the concentric parts in the presentation area. Each successive concentric part inward corresponds to a next lower hierarchical level."
221,Thread Arcs: An email thread visualization,"This paper describes Thread Arcs, a novel interactive visualization technique designed to help people use threads found in email. Thread Arcs combine the chronology of messages with the branching tree structure of a conversational thread in a mixed-model visualization by Venolia and Neustaedter (2003) that is stable and compact. By quickly scanning and interacting with Thread Arcs, people can see various attributes of conversations and find relevant messages in them easily. We tested this technique against other visualization techniques with users' own email in a functional prototype email client. Thread Arcs proved an excellent match for the types of threads found in users' email for the qualities users wanted in small-scale visualizations."
222,Effective Visualization of Hierarchical Graphs With the Cityscape Metaphor,"In this paper, we describe an implementation of the cityscape metaphor to visualize trees. The cityscape metaphor is a generalization of barcharts in 3D. Our approach serves for better exploitation of human perception capabilities. To achieve this we employ effective visual cues like node position and size. We determine node positions in terms of perceptual organization. Further we determine node sizes for providing redundant hierarchical information. Redundancy aides in better understanding the tree structure. Finally, we point out some of the advantages of this approach to other spatial metaphors such as cone trees."
223,Geophylogenies and the Map of Life,"One hundred and fifty years after Charles Darwin wrote his ``Origin of Species'', two major ongoing Web-based scientific projects are collating information on the earth's biological diversity. The Encyclopaedia of Life (EoL) provides a single interface through which information on each being of the same class can be accessed, whereas The Tree of Life (ToL) Web project places these classes onto an evolutionary tree. Here, I propose that a third complementary project should now be considered, the Map of Life (MoL), in which all we know about the biogeographical history of life -- including clades, species, their genes, and the communities they are members of -- is threaded through a dynamic earth history, capturing the spatiotemporal pathways that underlie current and past patterns of biodiversity."
224,"InfoSky: A System for Visual Exploration of Very Large, Hierarchically Structured Knowledge Spaces","This publication presents InfoSky, a system enabling exploration of large, hierarchically structured knowledge spaces. InfoSky employs a two-dimensional graphical representation with variable magnification, much like a real-world telescope, to visualise individual documents as stars, hierarchical structures as constellations, and the whole knowledge repository as a galaxy. Force-directed placement is used to position topically similar documents in geometric adjacency, and modified Voronoi diagrams are employed to construct non-overlapping constellation boundaries, while statistical text processing extracts abstracts and keywords from documents and collections. InfoSky combines hierarchy and topical similarity in a visualisation using a striking, well-known metaphor, providing users with a tool appropriate for today’s large, hierarchically structured document repositories."
225,H-v drawings of binary trees,"This chapter considers h-v drawings of binary trees and presents new results on it. We prove that binary trees with n nodes can be h-v drawn so that the total edge length is O(n log log n), and so that the maximum edge length is O(SQRT(n log n)."
226,"Three-Dimensional Phylogeny Explorer: Distinguishing paralogs, lateral transfer, and violation of ''molecular clock´´ assumption with 3D visualization","Construction and interpretation of phylogenetic trees has been a major research topic for understanding the evolution of genes. Increases in sequence data and complexity are creating a need for more powerful and insightful tree visualization tools. We have developed 3D Phylogeny Explorer (3DPE), a novel phylogeny tree viewer that maps trees onto three spatial axes (species on the X-axis; paralogs on Z; evolutionary distance on Y), enabling one to distinguish at a glance evolutionary features such as speciation; gene duplication and paralog evolution; lateral gene transfer; and violation of the ""molecular clock"" assumption. Users can input any tree on the online 3DPE, then rotate, scroll, rescale, and explore it interactively as ""live"" 3D views. All objects in 3DPE are clickable to display subtrees, connectivity path highlighting, sequence alignments, and gene summary views, and etc. To illustrate the value of this visualization approach for microbial genomes, we also generated 3D phylogeny analyses for all clusters from the public COG database. We constructed tree views using well-established methods and graph algorithms. We used Scientific Python to generate VRML2 3D views viewable in any web browser. 3DPE provides a novel phylogenetic tree projection method into 3D space and its web-based implementation with live 3D features for reconstruction of phylogenetic trees of COG database."
227,Label Embedded Treemapping: A Label Overlap Prevention Technique for Zoomable Treemaps and a User Interaction Technique,"Data navigation of a treemap -- a widely used tool for visualizing tree data -- becomes more difficult as the amount of data increases. To solve this problem, treemap techniques using zoomable user interface (ZUI) methods -- the most typical of which is the zoomable treemap (ZTM) -- have been proposed. However, ZTMs can incur face text overlapping issues between examined nodes. In order to increase ZTM readability, we propose a label embedded tree map technique that prevents label overlapping and a direct node selection method for the highlighting of focused parent nodes. The proposed tree map technique resolves the ZTM label conflict and the direct node selection method can efficiently improve data navigation."
228,Botanical Visualization of Huge Hierarchies,"A new method for the visualization of huge hierarchical data structures is presented. The method is based on the observation that we can easily see the branches, leaves, and their arrangement in a botanical tree, despite of the large number of elements. The strand model of Holton is used to convert an abstract tree into a geometric model. Nonleaf nodes are mapped to branches and child nodes to subbranches. A naive application of this model leads to unsatisfactory results, hence it is tailored to suit our purposes better. Continuing branches are emphasized, long branches are contracted, and sets of leaves are shown as fruit. The method is applied to the visualization of directory structures. The elements, directories and files, as well as their relations can easily be extracted, thereby showing that the use of methods from botanical modeling can be effective for information visualization."
229,Representing Points in Many Dimensions by Trees and Castles,"A number of points in k dimensions are displayed by associating with each point a symbol: a drawing of a tree or a castle. All symbols have the same structure derived from a hierarchical clustering algorithm applied to the k variables (dimensions) over all points, but their parts are coded according to the coordinates of each individual point. Trees and castles show general size effects, the change of whole clusters of variables from point to point, trends, and outliers. They are especially appropriate for evaluating the clustering of variables and for observing clusters of points. Their major advantage over earlier attempts to represent multivariate observations (such as profiles, stars, faces, boxes, and Andrews's curves) lies in their matching of relationships between variables to relationships between features of the representing symbol. Several examples are given, including one with 48 variables."

232,Edge Equalized Treemaps,"Treemap is a visualization method for hierarchical structures in which nodes are drawn as rectangles and arranged in a nested style. Several variations of Treemap have been developed to represent different types of data. In this paper, we propose an Edge Equalized Treemap, a representation that embeds visual data such as a bar chart in leaf rectangles. This representation is characterized by leaf rectangles of equal widths. Because their widths are equal, the scale intervals of charts in a leaf rectangle can be unified, meaning that we can compare charts simply by looking at them. We compare the Edge Equalized Treemap with existing layout methods, and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach."
233,Fractal Approaches for Visualizing Huge Hierarchies,"This paper describes fractal approaches to the problems which associate with visualizing huge hierarchies. The geometrical characteristic of a fractal, self-similarity, allows users to visually interact with a huge tree in the same manner at every level of the tree. The fractal dimension, a measure of complexity, makes it possible to control the total amount of displayed nodes. A prototype visualization system for UNIX directories is also shown."
234,Fractal views: A fractal-based method for controlling information display,"Computer users often must view large amounts of information through video displays which are physically limited in size. Although some methods, which automatically display/erase information units based on their degrees of importance, have been proposed, they lack an ability to keep the total amount of displayed information nearly constant. We propose a new method for information display based on fractal theory. By regarding the information structures used in computers as complex objects, we can abstract these objects as well as control their amount. Using our method, (1) the total amount of information is kept nearly constant even when users change their focuses of attention and (2) this amount can be set flexibly. Through mathematical analysis, we show our method's ability to control the amount. An application to program display is also shown. When this method is applied to the display of structured programs, it provides fisheye-like views which integrate local details around the focal point and major landmarks further away."
235,Improving Stability and Compactness in Street Layout Visualizations,"We present and evaluate improvements for Street Layout, a technique that can be used for visualizing evolving hierarchical data such as file structures or software systems. Street Layouts represent data as street networks, where each street represents a branch of the hierarchy and buildings around streets represent leaves. We extended the initial idea in various ways to increase compactness and visual stability. Our approaches are compared against the current methods in a conducted technical evaluation. A prototypic application shows the applicability of our improvements for visualizing a real world data set."
236,Information visualization using a new focus+context technique in combination with dynamic clustering of information space,"This paper presents work in progress on our approach to visualizing multi-dimensional and hierarchical information. We propose two new graphical user interfaces, the Magic Eye View (MEV) and ShapeVis to explore information spaces. In order to cope with large information sets we combine MEV and ShapeVis with dynamic hierarchical clustering of information units The Magic Eye View, which implements a new Focus+Context technique, is used as the interface for visualizing those hierarchies. In order to support detailed exploration of the information space (e.g analysis of certain cluster nodes or hierarchy levels) a new technique for visualizing multidimensional information is used. ShapeVis provides 2D or 3D representations of the information objects according to the selected subset of the information space Objects are represented as small closed free-form-surfaces. The location, size and shape of these surfaces describe the original objects in the information space uniquely according to their properties."
237,Icicle Plot: Better Displays for Hierarchical Clustering,"An icicle plot is a method for presenting a hierarchical clustering. Compared with other methods of presentation, it is far easier in an icicle plot to read off which objects belong to which clusters, and which objects join or drop out from a cluster as we move up and down the levels of the hierarchy, though these benefits only appear when enough objects are being clustered. Icicle plots are described, and their benefits are illustrated using a clustering of 48 objects."
238,Visualization of Contents Archive by Contour Map Representation,"This article describes a model for sustainable contents management, its visualization algorithms, and the implemented system, called sustainable knowledge globe (SKG). The focal point of our study is visualization using contour maps. The graphical representation of tree-structured contents increases in complexity with the number of contents. The contour map representations can briefly depict the arrangement and structure of contents in an archive. Three contour map representations are proposed assuming the importance of the arrangement design. Nesting, dendroidal, and island-like contours are amplified from the viewpoint of preservation of the structures and arrangements, in addition to supporting shape and texture design. The comparison and applications of the three algorithms are discussed."
239,Interaction Techniques for a Strata Treemap,"The Strata treemap is a new approach to hierarchy visualization that improves hierarchical structure visibility without distorting node sizes or missing nodes. In this paper, we present useful interaction techniques and visual cues that fit the Strata treemap."
240,A visualization by Innovated Squarified Treemap for somatosensory data analysis,"Enormous information in the Internet, especially in the health care field, makes users cannot get the information they want in time. To let medical staffs, even patients and users, absorb and understand information quickly, data visualization converts information to graphic style. However, some treemap algorithms are not suitable for displaying on certain conditions. This study proposes an improved algorithm, Innovated Squarified Treemap (iS qT), to process the information by data visualization. A comparison shows that our iS qT algorithm provides better performance than original Squarified Treemap algorithm. We expect this paper to facilitate the information be read easier by our iS qT approach in the rehabilitation field."
241,Hyperbolic Wheel: A Novel Hyperbolic Space Graph Viewer for Hierarchical Information Content,"Tree and graph structures have been widely used to present hierarchical and linked data. Hyperbolic trees are special types of graphs composed of nodes (points or vertices) and edges (connecting lines), which are visualized on a non-Euclidean space. In traditional Euclidean space graph visualization, distances between nodes are measured by straight lines. Displays of large graphs in Euclidean spaces may not utilize efficiently the available space and may impose limitations on the number of graph nodes. The special hyperbolic space rendering of tree-graphs enables adaptive and efficient use of the available space and facilitates the display of large hierarchical structures. In this paper we report on a newly developed advanced hyperbolic graph viewer, Hyperbolic Wheel, which enables the navigation, traversal, discovery and interactive manipulation of information stored in large hierarchical structures. Examples of such structures include personnel records, disc directory structures, ontological constructs, web-pages and other nested partitions. The Hyperbolic Wheel framework provides an intuitive and dynamic graphical interface to explore and retrieve information about individual nodes (data objects) and their relationships (data associations). The Hyperbolic Wheel is freely available online for educational and research purposes."
242,A focus+context technique based on hyperbolic geometry for visualizing large hierarchies,"We present a new focus+context (fisheye) technique for visualizing and manipulating large hierarchies. Our technique assigns more display space to a portion of the hierarchy while still embedding it in the context of the entire hierarchy. The essence of this scheme is to lay out the hierarchy in a uniform way on a hyperbolic plane and map this plane onto a circular display region. This supports a smooth blending between focus and context, as well as continuous redirection of the focus. We have developed effective procedures for manipulating the focus using pointer clicks as well as interactive dragging, and for smoothly animating transitions across such manipulation. A laboratory experiment comparing the hyperbolic browser with a conventional hierarchy browser was conducted."
243,The Hyperbolic Browser: A Focus+Context Technique for Visualizing Large Hierarchies,"We present a new focus+context technique based on hyperbolic geometry for visualizing and manipulating large hierarchies. Our technique assigns more display space to a portion of the hierarchy while still embedding it in the context of the entire hierarchy. We lay out the hierarchy in a uniform way on a hyperbolic plane and map this plane onto a display region. The chosen mapping provides a fisheye distortion that supports a smooth blending of focus and context. We have deveoped effective procedures for manipulating the focus using pointer clicks as well as interactive dragging and for smoothly animating transitions across such manipulation. Enhancements to the core mechanisms provide support for multiple foci, control of the tradeoff between node density and node display space, and for visualizing graphs by transforming them into trees."
244,Visualizing large trees using the hyperbolic browser,"We demonstrate a focus+context (fisheye) scheme for visualizing and manipulating large hierarchies. Our approach is to lay out the hierarchy uniformly on the hyperbolic plane and map this plane onto a circular display region. The projection onto the disk provides a natural mechanism for assigning more space to a portion of the hierarchy while still embedding it in a much larger context. Change of focus is accomplished by translating the structure on the hyperbolic plane, which allows a smooth transition without compromising the presentation of the context."
245,Layout of node-link structures in space with negative curvature,"Layout data indicate positions in a negatively curved layout space for nodes in a hierarchical branch of a node-link structure. The layout data indicate a parent position for parent nodes and, for children that share a parent node, child positions approximately along a circle in the layout space with the parent position approximately at the circle's center. Adjacent child positions are separated by approximately a base spacing. The radii of circles within the branch together approximate a function that increases slowly with number of child nodes such that the radii and spacings along circles are all approximately uniform within the branch. The layout data can be obtained from data defining the node-link structure. The layout data can be used to perform mappings, each obtaining positions for a subset of the nodes. The layout data can be used to present a first representation of the node-link structure on a display. In response to a user signal indicating a change from a first display position near a first feature to a second display position, a second representation can be presented that is perceptible as a changed continuation of the first. The second representation includes, near the second display position, a second feature representing the same part of the node-link structure as the first feature. The second representation can be obtained by a transformation of the layout space, which can be a discrete approximation of a hyperbolic plane."
246,Displaying node-link structure with region of greater spacings and peripheral branches,"Node-link data defining a node-link structure are used to present a sequence of representations on a display. The last representation in the sequence is perceptible as a changed continuation of the first. Each representation includes bounded node features, each with a center of area and a nearest node spacing that define a mid-spacing circle. All mid-spacing circles together determine an outer convex hull enclosing a total area for the representation. The mid-spacing circles of a subset of more spaced node features determine an inner convex hull enclosing approximately half the total area and enclosing a region in which nearest node spacings are in general perceptibly greater than in another region outside the second convex hull. The node features also represent a peripheral branch with lower level nodes that are not represented by more spaced node features. In the peripheral branch, node features that share a parent have centers of area positioned approximately along an arc with sufficiently similar spacings from the center of area of the parent node feature and from adjacent node features that they are perceptible as a group of related node features. The inner convex hulls of the first and last representations include subsets of node features representing different sets of nodes. The sequence can produce a perception that one node feature's nearest node spacing increases while another's decreases. The representations can be presented by a series of iterations, and can be presented at animation speeds to produce a perception of continuously moving node features."
247,Visualization-based analysis of quality for large-scale software systems,"We propose an approach for complex software analysis based on visualization. Our work is motivated by the fact that in spite of years of research and practice, software development and maintenance are still time and resource consuming, and high-risk activities. The most important reason in our opinion is the complexity of many phenomena related to software, such as its evolution and its reliability. In fact, there is very little theory explaining them. Today, we have a unique opportunity to empirically study these phenomena, thanks to large sets of software data available through open-source programs and open repositories. Automatic analysis techniques, such as statistics and machine learning, are usually limited when studying phenomena with unknown or poorly-understood influence factors. We claim that hybrid techniques that combine automatic analysis with human expertise through visualization are excellent alternatives to them. In this paper, we propose a visualization framework that supports quality analysis of large-scale software systems. We circumvent the problem of size by exploiting perception capabilities of the human visual system."
248,Visual analysis of Azureus using VERSO,"In this challenge report, we will see how to use VERSO in order to analyse Azureus. We answer the challenge through two separate main goals which represent two possible tasks available in VERSO. The first task is design anomaly detection and the second task is evolution analysis."
249,Spherical Layout for 3D Tree Visualization,"The 3D tree visualization faces multiples challenges: the election of an appropriate layout, the use of the interactions that make it easier the data exploration and a metaphor that helps the information understanding. A good combination of these three elements (layout, interactions and metaphor) will result in a visualization that effectively convey the key features of a complex structure or system to a wide range of users and permits the analytical reasoning process. The goal of this work was centered in the 3D tree visualization. In spite of their apparent simplicity, the displaying of a tree in 3D can also introduce new problems that can be overcome with the appropriate interactions. So, we have developed a new visualization technique for 3D tree visualization; this includes the design of a new tree layout that we called Spherical layout and the set of interactions that can be applied on this representation. This technique allows representing hierarchical structures to different levels of detail and also can be used as a visualization technique that allows a tree with attribute to be visualized. The Spherical layout has shown good result for large trees without compromising the performance; this is a key issue in tree visualization."
250,Spherical Layout Implementation using Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations,"The 3D tree visualization faces multiple challenges: the election of an appropriate layout, the use of the interactions that make the data exploration easier and a metaphor that helps in the process of information understanding. A good combination of these elements will result in a visualization that effectively conveys the key features of a complex structure or system to a wide range of users and permits the analytical reasoning process. In previous works we presented the Spherical Layout, a technique for 3D tree visualization that provides an excellent base to achieve those key features. The layout was implemented using the TriSphere algorithm, a method that discretized the spheres's surfaces with triangles to achieve a uniform distribution of the nodes. The goal of this work was centered in a new algorithm for the implementation of the Spherical layout; we called it the Weighted Spherical Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (WSCVT). In this paper we present a detailed description of this new implementation and a comparison with the TriSphere algorithm."
251,User Experience with Spherical Layout,"The 3D tree visualization faces multiples challenges: the selection of an appropriate layout and the use of proper interactions will help the information understanding. A good combination of these two elements (layout + interactions) will result in a visualization that effectively conveys the key features of a complex structure or system to a wide range of users and permits the analytical reasoning process. In previous work we have presented the Spherical layout; this layout allows the representation of larger information sets, at different levels of detail in a 3D environment. The goal of this work was centered in a user experience for this layout. We developed a file browser application based on the Spherical layout, called Brows.AR, and compared it with Windows File Browser. The results of this experience are shown in this paper."
252,Intelligent positioning of items in a tree map visualization,Displaying data from a data set in a tree map visualization is provided by prioritizing the data in the data set so as to associate a priority with respective elements of the data in the data set. A tree map visualization is generated based on the data set where a location of bounding boxes in the tree map is based on the priority associated with the corresponding element. Tree maps having locations of bounding boxes that are based on a priority associated with the bounding boxes are also provided.

254,Det. (Distance Encoded Tree): A Scalable Visualization Tool for Mapping Multiple Traits to Large Evolutionary Trees,"Evolutionary biologists are often interested in finding correlations among biological traits (or attributes) across a number of species, as such correlations may lead to testable hypotheses about the underlying function. Because some species are more closely related than others, computing and visualizing these correlations must be done in the context of the evolutionary tree that relates the species. Although dozens of visualizations for correlated traits have been developed over the decades, the recent explosive growth in the number of traits and species has created a need for a visualization that can scale to dozens of traits mapped to thousands of species and their evolutionary tree to allow the interactive exploration of complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce Det., called detective, an evolutionary tree visualization that allows biologists to see multiple attributes of leaf nodes. We describe a new tree layout algorithm to represent different branch lengths and several visualization and intereaction techniques to address user requirements. We also report informal feedbacks we collected from evolutionary biologists."
255,PhyloDet: A scalable visualization tool for mapping multiple traits to large evolutionary trees,"Evolutionary biologists are often interested in finding correlations among biological traits across a number of species, as such correlations may lead to testable hypotheses about the underlying function. Because some species are more closely related than others, computing and visualizing these correlations must be done in the context of the evolutionary tree that relates species. In this note, we introduce PhyloDet (short for PhyloDetective), an evolutionary tree visualization tool that enables biologists to visualize multiple traits mapped to the tree."
256,Visualizing tree structure with different edge lengths,"A system described herein includes a receiver component that receives multiple data elements, wherein each of the data elements has a common attribute, and wherein the several data elements are hierarchically related. The system may further include an assignor component that independently assigns each of the multiple data elements to one of a plurality of layers, wherein a data element is assigned to a layer based at least in part upon a value of the common attribute that corresponds to the data element. The system may also include a renderer component that receives assignments made by the assignor component and graphically renders a tree structure based at least in part upon the assignments. Furthermore, a color bar can be generated that includes one or more rows based at least in part upon content of the tree structure."
257,Angular Treemaps -- A New Technique for Visualizing and Emphasizing Hierarchical Structures,"Space-filling visualization techniques have proved their capability in visualizing large hierarchical structured data. However, most existing techniques restrict their partitioning process in vertical and horizontal direction only, which cause problem with identifying hierarchical structures. This paper presents a new space-filling method named Angular Treemaps that relax the constraint of the rectangular subdivision. The approach of Angular Treemaps utilizes divide and conquer paradigm to visualize and emphasize large hierarchical structures within a compact and limited display area with better interpretability. Angular Treemaps generate various layouts to highlight hierarchical sub-structure based on user's preferences or system recommendations. It offers flexibility to be adopted into a wider range of applications, regarding different enclosing shapes. Preliminary usability results suggest user's performance by using this technique is improved in locating and identifying categorized analysis tasks."
258,Visualizing large trees with divide & conquer partition,"While prior works on enclosure approach, guarantees the space utilization of a single geometrical area, mostly rectangle, this paper proposes a flexible enclosure tree layout method for partitioning various polygonal shapes that break through the limitation of rectangular constraint. Similar to Treemap techniques, it uses enclosure to divide display space into smaller areas for its sub-hierarchies. The algorithm can partition a polygonal shape or even an arbitrary shape into smaller polygons, rotated rectangles or vertical-horizontal rectangles. The proposed method and implementation algorithms provide an effective interactive visualization tool for partitioning large hierarchical structures within a confined display area with different shapes for real-time applications. We demonstrated the effective of the new method with a case study, an automated evaluation and a usability study."
259,Divide and Conquer Treemaps: Visualizing large trees with various shapes,"Most existing treemaps achieve the space utilization of a single geometrical area, mostly rectangle. Limiting visualization to rectangles could block the human capability on graph recognition, including orientation, shape and differentiation etc. To relax rectangular constraint, we propose a flexible enclosure approach with three algorithms. It partitions large hierarchical structures within a confined display area with different shapes for real-time applications. Our approach is based on the combination of Divide-and-Conquer method and the treemap paradigm. The partitioning algorithms generate three types of layouts with polygonal, angular and rectangular titling, which are flexible to be used separately or combined. We present technical details including the visualization results in the experiments and in the cases studies with real data sets. We evaluated the visualization based on graph drawing aesthetics and optimization criteria. Our usability study shows that (1) treemaps with layout variability support utilization of human capability in graph perception and (2) treemaps adopted in different shaped containers could have a positive impact on user satisfaction and awareness during visual data exploration."
260,Visualization of Software and Systems as Support Mechanism for Integrated Software Project Control,"Many software development organizations still lack support for obtaining intellectual control over their software development processes and for determining the performance of their processes and the quality of the produced products. Systematic support for detecting and reacting to critical process and product states in order to achieve planned goals is usually missing. One means to institutionalize measurement on the basis of explicit models is the development and establishment of a so-called Software Project Control Center (SPCC) for systematic quality assurance and management support. An SPCC is comparable to a control room, which is a well known term in the mechanical production domain. One crucial task of an SPCC is the systematic visualization of measurement data in order to provide context-, purpose-, and role-oriented information for all stakeholders (e.g., project managers, quality assurance managers, developers) during the execution of a software development project. The article will present an overview of SPCC concepts, a concrete instantiation that supports goal-oriented data visualization, as well as examples and experiences from practical applications."
261,Mixed-Projection Treemaps: A novel approach mixing 2D and 2.5D Treemaps,"This paper presents a novel technique for combining 2D and 2.5D treemaps using multi-perspective views to leverage the advantages of both treemap types. It enables a new form of overview+detail visualization for tree-structured data and contributes new concepts for real-time rendering of and interaction with treemaps. The technique operates by tilting the graphical elements representing inner nodes using affine transformations and animated state transitions. We explain how to mix orthogonal and perspective projections within a single treemap. Finally, we show application examples that benefit from the reduced interaction overhead."
262,On mapping complete binary trees into grids and extended grids,"We consider one-to-one, congestion one layouts of complete binary trees into 2-D grids and extended 2-D grids. For such a layout of the complete binary tree $T_h$ of height h into the square $ntimes n$ grid we consider the layout's expansion ratio r=n*n/(2^(h+1) -1). For r the least expansion among layouts of $T_h$ into grids, we obtain the bounds 1.122<=r<=1.4656 for large h and n. For layouts into extended grids we similarly obtain bounds 1.03<=r<=1.115. The upper bounds are improvements on previous work, while the lower bounds are the first such to appear."
263,Expansion of layouts of complete binary trees into grids,"Let $T_h$ be the complete binary tree of height h. Let M be the infinite grid graph with vertex set Z^2, where two vertices (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) of M are adjacent if and only if |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|=1. Suppose that T is a tree which is a subdivision of $T_h$ and is also isomorphic to a subgraph of M. Motivated by issues in optimal VLSI design, we show that the point expansion ratio $n(T)/n(T_h)=n(T)/(2^(h+1)-1)$ is bounded below by 1.122 for h sufficiently large. That is, we give bounds on how many vertices of degree 2 must be inserted along the edges of $T_h$ in order that the resulting tree can be laid out in the grid. Concerning the constructive end of VLSI design, suppose that T is a tree which is a subdivision of $T_h$ and is also isomorphic to a subgraph of the $ntimes n$ grid graph. Define the expansion ratio of such a layout to be $n*n/n(T_h)=n*n/(2^(h+1)-1)$. We show constructively that the minimum possible expansion ratio over all layouts of $T_h$ is bounded above by 1.4656 for sufficiently large h. That is, we give efficient layouts of complete binary trees into square grids, making improvements upon the previous work of others. We also give bounds for the point expansion and expansion problems for layouts of Th into extended grids, i.e. grids with added diagonals."
264,On Balloon Drawings of Rooted Trees,"Among various styles of tree drawing, balloon drawing, where each subtree is enclosed in a circle, enjoys a desirable feature of displaying tree structures in a rather balanced fashion. We first design an efficient algorithm to optimize angular resolution and aspect ratio for the balloon drawing of rooted unordered trees. For the case of ordered trees for which the center of the enclosing circle of a subtree need not coincide with the root of the subtree, flipping the drawing of a subtree (along the axis from the parent to the root of the subtree) might change both the aspect ratio and the angular resolution of the drawing. We show that optimizing the angular resolution as well as the aspect ratio with respect to this type of rooted ordered trees is reducible to the perfect matching problem for bipartite graphs, which is solvable in polynomial time. Aside from studying balloon drawing from an algorithmic viewpoint, we also propose a local magnetic spring model for producing dynamic balloon drawings with applications to the drawings of galaxy systems, H-trees, and sparse graphs, which are of practical interest."
265,On Balloon Drawings of Rooted Trees,"Among various styles of tree drawing reported in the literature, balloon drawing enjoys a desirable feature of displaying tree structures in a rather balanced fashion. Each subtree in the balloon drawing of a tree is enclosed in a circle. Along any path from the root node, the radius of each circle reflects the number of descendants associated with the root node of the subtree. In this paper, we investigate various issues related to balloon drawings of rooted trees from the algorithmic viewpoint. First, we design an efficient algorithm to optimize the angular resolution and the aspect ratio for the balloon drawings of rooted unordered trees. For the case of ordered trees for which the center of the enclosing circle of a subtree need not coincide with the root of the subtree, flipping the drawing of a subtree (along the axis from the parent to the root of the subtree) might change both the aspect ratio and the angular resolution of the drawing. We show that optimizing the angular resolution as well as the aspect ratio with respect to this type of rooted ordered trees is reducible to the perfect matching problem for bipartite graphs, which is solvable in polynomial time. In addition, a related problem concerning the optimization of the drawing area can be modelled as a specific type of nonlinear programming for which there exist several robust algorithms in practice. With a slight modification to the balloon drawing, we are able to generate the drawings of galaxy systems, H-trees, and sparse graphs, which are of practical interest."
266,Balloon Views of Source Code and Their Multiscalable Font Modes,"The majority of program editors available on the market support the view of a directory-explorer style to display only those code lines of interest. Among them, the fisheye and the fractal views of source code (in which each line has a value reflecting the degree of interest and importance) have received a lot of attention in the literature. In information visualization, drawing trees based on fractal theory also plays an interesting role as the so-called balloon drawing of hierarchical data includes two models: the fractal and the SNS (subtrees with nonuniform sizes) models. It is therefore natural to consider a new source code visualization style based on the SNS model of balloon drawing. A main feature of the SNS view is that the value of each line reflects the number of its descendants when the source code is viewed as a tree structure. Unlike the view of a directory-explorer style, the multiscalable font mode (which was originally utilized in the fractal view of source code) displays all the lines in such a way that each line has the font size proportional to its value. In this paper, we investigate various issues concerning the multiscalable font modes of the fish-eye, the fractal, and the SNS views of source code, in hope of providing guidelines for the programmer to better comprehend the program code in practice."
267,Visualizing Phylogenetic Trees by Spring-Embedder Models,"A phylogenetic tree is a graphical representation of the evolutionary relationship between taxonomic groups. The term phylogeny refers to the evolution or historical development of a plant or animal species, or even a human tribe or similar group. In order to make ourself to understand the structure of phylogenetic tree. We present a spring-embedder model for drawing rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees with straight edges. Our heuristic strives for uniform edge lengths, and we develop it in analogy to forces in natural systems, for a simple, elegant, conceptually intuitive, and efficient algorithm. These algorithms are implemented on a web-based phylogeny visualization system that interoperates with existing tools developed for phylogenetic processing including CLUSTAL W, PHYLIP, PAUP. The molecular biologists can also manually construct their phylogenetic tree via existing system in, e.g., the Phylip format produced by CLUSTAL W as input format of the web system to which this data is to be fed."
268,Algorithm for Improving the Aspect Ratio of Treemaps,
269,Complexity analysis of balloon drawing for rooted trees,"In a balloon drawing of a tree, all the children under the same parent are placed on the circumference of the circle centered at their parent, and the radius of the circle centered at each node along any path from the root reflects the number of descendants associated with the node. Among various styles of tree drawings reported in the literature, the balloon drawing enjoys a desirable feature of displaying tree structures in a rather balanced fashion. For each internal node in a balloon drawing, the ray from the node to each of its children divides the wedge accommodating the subtree rooted at the child into two sub-wedges. Depending on whether the two sub-wedge angles are required to be identical or not, a balloon drawing can further be divided into two types: even sub-wedge and uneven sub-wedge types. In the most general case, for any internal node in the tree there are two dimensions of freedom that affect the quality of a balloon drawing: (1) altering the order in which the children of the node appear in the drawing, and (2) for the subtree rooted at each child of the node, flipping the two sub-wedges of the subtree. In this paper, we give a comprehensive complexity analysis for optimizing balloon drawings of rooted trees with respect to angular resolution, aspect ratio and standard deviation of angles under various drawing cases depending on whether the tree is of even or uneven sub-wedge type and whether (1) and (2) above are allowed. It turns out that some are NP-complete while others can be solved in polynomial time. We also derive approximation algorithms for those that are intractable in general."

271,Linked Treemap: A 3D Treemap-nodelink layout for visualizing hierarchical structures,"Hierarchical structures are present in many different areas of our daily life as well as in sciences. Visualization methods are quite commonly applied to support comprehension of the more complex structures. Nodelinks and treemaps are two widely spread directions of such visualization methods. Visualizations using nodelinks have the advantage of explicitly displaying the hierarchical relations between entities. Visualizations using treemaps, on the other hand, allow for a good global understanding of the present entities and some of their properties. We present a visualization tool for hierarchical structures that combines the advantages of treemaps and nodelinks by naturally incorporating them into a 3D layout. The nodelink is built upon the treemap in a direction orthogonal to the treemap plane. Our visualization tool supports various navigation techniques suitable for different analysis tasks. First, the user interaction allows users to render subtrees of the nodelink transparently. Second, the various levels can be explored separately in an intuitive fashion by sliding its plane through the orthogonal nodelink layout and, thus, moving the treemap to the respective level of the hierarchy. Third, zooming into regions of interest is supported by using a focus+context technique that operates on the combined 3D layout. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our system for visual exploration purposes in a case study that uses our system as a file explorer. In this context, we perform a user study that evaluates our approach and allows for a comparison to other existing approaches."

Furthermore, an incremental layout method is adopted to handle information on a large scale.

273,Interactive Visual Analysis of the NSF Funding Information,"This paper presents an interactive visualization toolkit for navigating and analyzing the National Science Foundation (NSF) funding information. Our design builds upon the treemap layout and the stacked graph to contribute customized techniques for visually navigating and interacting with the hierarchical data of NSF programs and proposals, supporting visual search and analysis, and allowing the user to make informed decision. In this visualization toolkit, we propose two visualization techniques to simplify the navigation of the hierarchical data: 2.5 Dimensional treemaps to make the hierarchical structure more easily to be recognized, and labeled treemap to help the user to get a clear overview of the content of the structure and make the internal area of rectangles correspond to the weights of the data set. Furthermore, an incremental layout method is adopted to handle information on a large scale. The improved treemap visualization will help to visually analyze the static funding data and the stacked graph is utilized to analyze the time-series data. Through these visual analysis techniques, research trends of NSF, popular NSF programs are quickly identified. The primary contribution is a demonstration of novel ways to effectively present and analyze NSF funding data."
274,A hierarchical data visualization algorithm: Self-adapting Sunburst algorithm,"Sunburst is a hierarchical data visualization method which is filled by radial sectors, for the problem that sectors of Sunburst are placed in disorder and space utilization rate is low, Self-Adapting Sunburst Algorithm (SASA) has been proposed. Nodes are allocated their areas according to their attribute value, and siblings of same parents are made in ascending order according to the size of areas, adjusting the position of sectors. Meanwhile, based on total number of nodes in each layer, SASA dynamically determines width of this circular ring, following the principle ""more nodes wider circular ring and fewer nodes thinner circular ring"", and in this way, it can optimize the size of nested ring in Sunburst and improve space utilization rate. Finally, User Locating Efficiency (ULE) and Arc Ratio (AR) is put forward to examine SASA, Experimental results show that this algorithm can indeed optimize sector's arrangement, as well as make space utilization better."
275,CoVennTree: A new method for the comparative analysis of large datasets,"The visualization of massive datasets, such as those resulting from comparative metatranscriptome analyses or the analysis of microbial population structures using ribosomal RNA sequences, is a challenging task. We developed a new method called CoVennTree (Comparative weighted Venn Tree) that simultaneously compares up to three multifarious datasets by aggregating and propagating information from the bottom to the top level and produces a graphical output in Cytoscape. With the introduction of weighted Venn structures, the contents and relationships of various datasets can be correlated and simultaneously aggregated without losing information. We demonstrate the suitability of this approach using a dataset of 16S rDNA sequences obtained from microbial populations at three different depths of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea. CoVennTree has been integrated into the Galaxy ToolShed and can be directly downloaded and integrated into the user instance."
276,FanLens: A Visual Toolkit for Dynamically Exploring the Distribution of Hierarchical Attributes,"Radial, space-filling visualization is very useful for representing the distribution of attributes in hierarchical data; however it also suffers from its drawbacks in terms of view transition, context preservation, thin slices, flexibility and large sized data support. To address these problems, we propose FanLens, an enhancement upon existing approaches with new features like incremental layout and fisheye distortion based selecting. This visual toolkit also features dynamic hierarchy specification, dynamic visual property mapping, smooth animation, etc. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique with two examples of case study and results from informal user experiments."
277,Cascaded Treemaps: Examining the Visibility and Stability of Structure in Treemaps,"Treemaps are an important and commonly-used approach to hierarchy visualization, but an important limitation of treemaps is the difficulty of discerning the structure of a hierarchy. This paper presents cascaded treemaps, a new approach to treemap presentation that is based in cascaded rectangles instead of the traditional nested rectangles. Cascading uses less space to present the same containment relationship, and the space savings enable a depth effect and natural padding between siblings in complex hierarchies. In addition, we discuss two general limitations of existing treemap layout algorithms: disparities between node weight and relative node size that are introduced by layout algorithms ignoring the space dedicated to presenting internal nodes, and a lack of stability when generating views of different levels of treemaps as a part of supporting interactive zooming. We finally present a two-stage layout process that addresses both concerns, computing a stable structure for the treemap and then using that structure to consider the presentation of internal nodes when arranging the treemap. All of this work is presented in the context of two large real-world hierarchies, the Java package hierarchy and the eBay auction hierarchy."
278,Constructing a Labeled Treemap with Balanced Layout,"The present invention provides a method and system for constructing a labeled treemap with balanced layout. A range of possible densities of leaf nodes based on designated weights of the leaf nodes and a designated treemap region is determined. A range of possible densities is then searched for a density that could be fitted on and a labeled treemap that could fit on the density. The labeled treemap is presented on a specified display region. By introducing the concept of density into labeled treemap, the present invention ensures the area of region occupied by each leaf node in the constructed labeled treemap is approximately corresponding to the weight of the node, and avoids the case of invisible leaf node in a treemap."
279,Explode to Explain -- Illustrative Information Visualization,"Due to complexity, modern visualization techniques for large data volumes and complex interrelationships are difficult to understand for non-expert users and even for expert users the visualization result may be difficult to interpret. Often the limited screen space and the risk of occlusion hinders a meaningful explanation of techniques or datasets by additional visual elements. This paper presents a novel way how views from information visualization can be adapted by the use of the well-known illustrative technique ""exploded view"", to successfully face the problems described above. The application of exploded views gains screen space for an explanation in a smart way and acts explanatory itself. With our approach of illustrating visual representations, the understanding of complex visualization techniques is eased and new comprehensible views on data are given."
280,Fast detection and display of symmetry in trees,"The automatic construction of good drawings of abstract graphs is a problem of practical importance. Displaying symmetry appears as one of the main criteria for achieving goodness. An expression is obtained for the maximum number of axial symmetries of a tree which can be simultaneously displayed in a single drawing, and an algorithm is presented for constructing such a maximally-symmetric drawing. Similar results are also obtained for rotational symmetries in trees. The algorithms run in time which is linear in the size of the tree, and hence are optimal."
281,Compact layout of layered trees,"The standard layered drawing convention for trees in which the vertical placement of a node is given by its level in the tree and each node is centered between its children can lead to drawings which are quite wide. We present two new drawing conventions which reduce the layout width to be less than some maximum width while still maintaining the essential layered drawing convention. These conventions relax the requirement that a parent must be exactly placed midway between its children, and instead make this a preference which can be violated if this is required for the layout to fit into the required width. Both drawing conventions give rise to a simple kind of quadratic programming problem. We give an iterative gradient projection algorithm for solving this kind of problem, and also a linear time heuristic algorithm. Our algorithms are practical: a tree with three thousand nodes can be laid out in less than a hundred milliseconds with either algorithm."
282,Hi-Trees and Their Layout,"We introduce hi-trees, a new visual representation for hierarchical data in which, depending on the kind of parent node, the child relationship is represented using either containment or links. We give a drawing convention for hi-trees based on the standard layered drawing convention for rooted trees, then show how to extend standard bottom-up tree layout algorithms to draw hi-trees in this convention. We also explore a number of other more compact layout styles for layout of larger hi-trees and give algorithms for computing these. Finally, we describe two applications of hi-trees: argument mapping and business decision support."

285,Fractal representations of Cayley graphs,The visualization of Cayley graphs for many groups is possible using 3-D models. Most of our examples are Cayley graphs of infinite groups where we exploit automatic structures to efficiently produce computer images of the Cayley graphs. The infinite groups are visualized using fractal rescaling so that the infinite graph projects into a bounded domain. Varying the color choice for these fractal representations of the Cayley graphs allows the visual recognition of features such as positivity of the total exponent of the words.
286,Circular drawings of rooted trees,"We describe an algorithm producing circular layouts for trees, that is drawings, where subtrees of a node lie within circles, and these circles are themselves placed on the circumference of a circle. The complexity and methodology of our algorithm compares to Reingold and Tilford's algorithm for trees. Moreover, the algorithm naturally admits distortion transformations of the layout. This, added to its low complexity, makes it very well suited to be used in an interactive environment."
287,Parallel h-v drawings of binary trees,"In this paper we present a method to obtain optimal h-v and inclusion drawings in parallel. Based on parallel tree contraction, our method computes optimal (with respect to a class of cost functions of the enclosing rectangle) drawings in O(log2n) parallel time by using a polynomial number of EREW processors. The method can be extended to compute optimal inclusion layouts in the case where each leaf l of the tree is represented by rectangle l x*l y. Our method also yields an NC algorithm for the slicing floorplanning problem. Whether this problem was in NC was an open question."
288,A note on parallel algorithms for optimal h-v drawings of binary trees,"In this paper we present a method to obtain optimal h-v drawings in parallel. Based on parallel tree contraction, our method computes optimal (with respect to a class of cost functions of the enclosing rectangle) drawings in O(log2n) parallel time by using a polynomial number of EREW processors. The number of processors reduces substantially when we study minimum area drawings. Our work places the problem of obtaining optimal size h-v drawings in NC, presenting the first algorithm with polylogarithmic time complexity."
289,EVEVis: A Multi-Scale Visualization System for Dense Evolutionary Data,"Evolutionary simulations can produce datasets consisting of thousands or millions of separate entities, complete with their genealogical relationships. Biologists must examine this data to determine when and where these entities have changed, both on an individual basis and on a population-wide basis. Therefore, desirable features of a visualization system for evolutionary data are the capability of showing the status of the population at any given moment in time, good scalability, and smooth transition between high-level and low-level views. We propose a multi-scale visualization method, including a novel tree layout that both shows population status over time and can easily scale to very large populations. From this layout, the user can navigate to visualizations for moments in time or for individual entities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the visualization on an existing evolutionary simulation called EVE: Evolution in Variable Environments."
290,An Occlusion-Reduced 3D Hierarchical Data Visualization Technique,"Occlusion is an important problem to be solved for readability improvement of 3D visualization techniques. This paper presents an occlusion reduction technique for cityscape-style 3D visualization techniques. The paper first presents an algorithm for occlusion reduction. It generates bounding boxes of 3D objects on the 2D display space, moves them to reduce their overlap, and finally reversely projects their movements onto the 3D space. The paper then presents an application of the algorithm to our own hierarchical data visualization technique, and a music browser based on the technique. The paper also shows several numerical evaluations that denote the effectiveness of the presented technique."
291,Extension models of Cone Tree Visualizations to Large scale Knowledge base with Semantic Relations,"Cone Tree is an appealing interactive 3D visualization model for hierarchical data structure. In any prior studies, data objects for visualization were constructed by only tree structure, which contained small number of data and nodes. Subject domains in real world for visualization studies have highly complicated relations, which cannot to be expressed in a few nodes and only hierarchical structure. In this paper, we proposed the visualization technique based on cone tree model to apply for a large-scale knowledge base, which has complicated data structure. The EDR Electronic Dictionary as a large-scale knowledge base was used in our study. The visualization system fro EDR was implemented with Java 3D. This paper describes the technique and the implemented system, and discusses some problems on the technique."
292,Drawing dynamic trees,"A tree-drawing algorithm that addresses the weaknesses of current approaches to constructing graphical user interfaces is presented. Present algorithms either do not let you draw tree nodes of varying shapes and sizes or they draw such trees in a way that does not produce trees as compact as they could be, which is especially important when diagramming a large system. Also, they cannot reuse layout information when the trees changes, so after every change the layout must be recomputed and the tree redrawn. The main difference between these traditional approaches and the author's approach is that his algorithm is more geometric. Unlike other algorithms, it uses an explicit representation of node and subtree contours, and it stores every contour as a polygon. It has three advantages over traditional algorithms. It allows one to draw trees with nodes of any polygonal shape compactly. The data structure supports insert and delete operations on subtrees. It is simple to implement, yet flexible."
293,MoireTrees: Visualization and Interaction for Multi-Hierarchical Data,"Visualizing hierarchical data is one of the core areas of information visualization. Most of these techniques focus on single hierarchies - hierarchies with a single root element and a single path to each element. In contrast, this work focuses on the browsing of multi-hierarchies - hierarchies with multiple roots or multiple paths per element. A radial focus+context display algorithm and interaction methods are introduced to explore such multi-hierarchical data. A series of examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our new visualization."
294,Minimum-Layer Drawings of Trees,"A layered drawing of a tree T is a planar straight-line drawing of T, where the vertices of T are placed on some horizontal lines called layers. A minimum-layer drawing of T is a layered drawing of T on k layers, where k is the minimum number of layers required for any layered drawing of T. In this paper we give a linear-time algorithm for obtaining minimum-layer drawings of trees."
295,Visualizing Calling Context profiles with Ring Charts,"Calling context profiling is an important technique for analysing the performance of object-oriented software with complex inter-procedural control flow. A common data structure is the Calling Context Tree (CCT), which stores dynamic metrics, such as CPU time, separately for each calling context. As CCTs may comprise millions of nodes, there is need for a condensed visualization that eases the location of performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce Calling Context Ring Charts, a new compact visualization for CCTs, where callee methods are represented in ring segments surrounding the caller's ring segment. In order to reveal hot methods, their callers, and callees, the ring segments can be sized according to a chosen dynamic metric."
296,Visualizing and exploring profiles with calling context ring charts,"Calling context profiling is an important technique for analyzing the performance of object-oriented software with complex inter-procedural control flow. The Calling Context Tree (CCT) is a common data structure that stores dynamic metrics, such as CPU time, separately for each calling context. As CCTs may comprise millions of nodes, there is a need for a condensed visualization that eases the localization of performance bottlenecks. In this article, we discuss Calling Context Ring Charts (CCRCs), a compact visualization for CCTs, where callee methods are represented in ring segments surrounding the caller's ring segment. In order to reveal hot methods, their callers, and callees, the ring segments can be sized according to a chosen dynamic metric. We describe two case studies where CCRCs help us to detect and fix performance problems in applications. A performance evaluation also confirms that our implementation can efficiently handle large CCTs."
297,H3: laying out large directed graphs in 3D hyperbolic space,"We present the H3 layout technique for drawing large directed graphs as node-link diagrams in 3D hyperbolic space. We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees."
298,Exploring large graphs in 3D hyperbolic space,"Drawing graphs as nodes connected by links is visually compelling but computationally difficult. Hyperbolic space and spanning trees can reduce visual clutter, speed up layout, and provide fluid interaction. This article briefly describes a software system that explicitly attempts to handle much larger graphs than previous systems and support dynamic exploration rather than final presentation. It then discusses the applicability of this system to goals beyond simple exploration. A software system that supports graph exploration should include both a layout and an interactive drawing component. I have developed new algorithms for both layout and drawing (H3 and H3Viewer). The H3Viewer drawing algorithm remains under development, so this article presents preliminary results. I have implemented a software library that uses these algorithms. It can handle graphs of more than 100,000 edges by using a spanning tree as the backbone for the layout and drawing algorithms."
299,Drawing Large Graphs with H3Viewer and Site Manager,"We demonstrate the H3Viewer graph drawing library, which can be run from a standalone program or in conjunction with other programs such as SGI's Site Manager application. Our layout and drawing algorithms support interactive navigation of large graphs up to 100,000 edges. We present an adaptive drawing algorithm with a guaranteed frame rate. Both layout and navigation occur in 3D hyperbolic space, which provides a view of a large neighborhood around an easily changeable point of interest. We find an appropriate spanning tree to use as the backbone for fast layout and uncluttered drawing, and non-tree links can be displayed on demand. Our methods are appropriate when node or link annotations can guide the choice of a good parent from among all of the incoming links. Such annotations can be constructed using only a small amount of domain-specific knowledge, thus rendering tractable many graphs which may seem rather densely connected at first glance."
300,Interactive visualization of large graphs and networks,"Many real-world domains can be represented as large node-link graphs: backbone Internet routers connect with 70,000 other hosts, mid-sized Web servers handle between 20,000 and 200,000 hyperlinked documents, and dictionaries contain millions of words defined in terms of each other. Computational manipulation of such large graphs is common, but previous tools for graph visualization have been limited to datasets of a few thousand nodes. Visual depictions of graphs and networks are external representations that exploit human visual processing to reduce the cognitive load of many tasks that require understanding of global or local structure. We assert that the two key advantages of computer-based systems for information visualization over traditional paper-based visual exposition are interactivity and scalability. We also argue that designing visualization software by taking the characteristics of a target user's task domain into account leads to systems that are more effective and scale to larger datasets than previous work. This thesis contains a detailed analysis of three specialized systems for the interactive exploration of large graphs, relating the intended tasks to the spatial layout and visual encoding choices. We present two novel algorithms for specialized layout and drawing that use quite different visual metaphors. The H3 system for visualizing the hyperlink structures of web sites scales to datasets of over 100,000 nodes by using a carefully chosen spanning tree as the layout backbone, 3D hyperbolic geometry for a Focus+Context view, and provides a fluid interactive experience through guaranteed frame rate drawing. The Constellation system features a highly specialized 2D layout intended to spatially encode domain-specific information for computational linguists checking the plausibility of a large semantic network created from dictionaries. The Planet Multicast system for displaying the tunnel topology of the Internet's multicast backbone provides a literal 3D geographic layout of arcs on a globe to help MBone maintainers find misconfigured long-distance tunnels. Each of these three systems provides a very different view of the graph structure, and we evaluate their efficacy for the intended task. We generalize these findings in our analysis of the importance of interactivity and specialization for graph visualization systems that are effective and scalable."
301,TreeJuxtaposer: Scalable tree comparison using Focus+Context with guaranteed visibility,"Structural comparison of large trees is a difficult task that is only partially supported by current visualization techniques, which are mainly designed for browsing. We present TreeJuxtaposer, a system designed to support the comparison task for large trees of several hundred thousand nodes. We introduce the idea of ""guaranteed visibility"", where highlighted areas are treated as landmarks that must remain visually apparent at all times. We propose a new methodology for detailed structural comparison between two trees and provide a new nearly-linear algorithm for computing the best corresponding node from one tree to another. In addition, we present a new rectilinear Focus+Context technique for navigation that is well suited to the dynamic linking of side-by-side views while guaranteeing landmark visibility and constant frame rates. These three contributions result in a system delivering a fluid exploration experience that scales both in the size of the dataset and the number of pixels in the display. We have based the design decisions for our system on the needs of a target audience of biologists who must understand the structural details of many phylogenetic, or evolutionary, trees. Our tool is also useful in many other application domains where tree comparison is needed, ranging from network management to call graph optimization to genealogy."
302,Visualizing large trees and graphs using a 3D cone tree layout,"Tree and graph structures are often visualized as 2D linear tree diagrams with labeled dots and connecting lines. But when the data grows beyond several dozen nodes, these diagrams become large and awkward. This article looks at a 3D Cone Tree scheme for visualizing trees and graphs with several thousand nodes. I outline the layout algorithm, show examples, and discuss strengths and weaknesses for the approach."
303,PhylloTrees: Phyllotactic Patterns for Tree Layout,"Motivations for drawing hierarchical structures are probably as diverse as datasets to visualize. This ubiquity of tree structures has lead to a manifold of tree layout algorithms and tree visualization systems. While many tree layouts exist, increasingly massive data sets, expanding computational power, and still relatively limited display space make tree layout algorithms a topic of ongoing interest. We explore the use of nature's phyllotactic patterns to inform the layout of hierarchical data. These naturally occurring patterns provide a non-overlapping, optimal packing when the total number of nodes is not known a priori. We present PhylloTrees, a family of expandable tree layouts based on these patterns."
304,Method and apparatus for the viewing and exploration of the content of hierarchical information,"A method for the conversion and display of tree-structured information to a ""treetable"", a table-like display structure, in which each path from a root to a leaf node is represented by a single column, and cells representing the immediate successors of a node are placed immediately under that node. Variation in the amount of space given to cells within particular columns is used to allow more detail to be given for selected paths and subtrees. Extraction of subparts of a treetable into another such structure is used for deeper exploration of trees. The treetable structure is also suitable for use as a selector and guide to the reading, in auxiliary displays, of the concatenated node content associated with either (a) individual columns (representing full paths), or (b) all successors to a given node."
305,Method and apparatus for the construction and use of table-like visualizations of hierarchic material,"A method for the conversion and display of tree-structured information to a ""treetable"", a table-like display structure, in which each path from a root to a leaf node is represented by a single column, and cells representing the immediate successors of a node are placed immediately under that node. Variation in the amount of space given to cells within particular columns is used to allow more detail to be given for selected paths and subtrees. Extraction of subparts of a treetable into another such structure is used for deeper exploration of trees. The treatable structure is also suitable for use as a selector and guide to the reading, in auxiliary displays, of the concatenated node content associated with either (a) individual columns (representing full paths), or (b) all successors to a given node."
306,A visualization tool for interactive learning of large decision trees,"Decision tree induction is certainly among the most applicable learning techniques due to its power and simplicity. However learning decision trees from large datasets, particularly in data mining, is quite different from learning from small or moderately sized datasets. When learning from large datasets, decision tree induction programs often produce very large trees. How to efficiently visualize trees in the learning process, particularly large trees, is still questionable and currently requires efficient tools. The paper presents a visualization tool for interactive learning of large decision trees, that includes a new visualization technique called T2.5D (Trees 2.5 Dimensions). After a brief discussion on requirements for tree visualizers and related work, the paper focuses on presenting developing techniques for two issues: (1) how to visualize efficiently large decision trees; and (2) how to visualize decision trees in the learning process"
307,A Space-Optimized Tree Visualization,"We describe a new method for the visualization of tree structured relational data. It can be used especially for the display of very large hierarchies in a 2-dimensional space. We discuss the advantages and limitations of current techniques of tree visualization. Our strategy is to optimize the drawing of trees in a geometrical plane and maximize the utilization of display space by allowing more nodes and links to be displayed at a limit screen resolution. We use the concept of enclosure to partition the entire display space into a collection of local regions that are assigned to all nodes in tree T for the display of their sub-trees and themselves. To enable the exploration of large hierarchies, we use a modified semantic zooming technique to view the detail of a particular part of the hierarchy at a time based on user's interest. Layout animation is also provided to preserve the mental map while the user is exploring the hierarchy by changing zoomed views."
308,Improvements of Space-Optimized Tree for Visualizing and Manipulating Very Large Hierarchies,This paper describes some improvements over the original Space-Optimized Tree technique for the visualization and manipulation of very large hierarchies. The new system uses an improved algorithm to calculate geometrical layouts and it also provides better navigation capability. We introduce our new layout algorithm that can make more consistence of the display than the original layout technique made. We also combine DualView (a new focus+context technique) with the current modified semantic zooming in order to interactively navigate through the large and very large hierarchies.
309,Space-optimized tree: A connection+enclosure approach for the visualization of large hierarchies,"This paper describes a new approach, space-optimized tree, for the visualization and navigation of tree-structured relational data. This technique can be used especially for the display of very large hierarchies in a two-dimensional space. We discuss the advantages and limitations of current techniques of tree visualization. Our strategy is to optimize the drawing of trees in a geometrical plane and maximize the utilization of display space by allowing more nodes and links to be displayed at a limited screen resolution. Space-optimized tree is a connection+enclosure visualization approach that recursively positions children of a subtree into polygon areas and still uses a node-link diagram to present the entire hierarchical structure. To be able to handle the navigation of large hierarchies, we use a new hybrid viewing technique that combines two viewing methods, the modified semantic zooming and a focus+context technique. While the semantic zooming technique can enlarge a particular viewing area by filtering out the rest of tree structure from the visualization, the focus+context technique allows the user to interactively focus, view and browse the entire visual structure with a reasonable high-density display."
310,Hierarchical Information Visualization using ENCCON Model,"This paper describes a new efficient approach for visualizing large hierarchical information. Our technique is based on the connection + enclosure visualization model from which the area division is used for the recursive positioning of nodes, while a node-link diagram is still drawn to present the entire hierarchical structure. We inherit the advantages of Space-Optimized (SO) Tree technique that can enhance the usability of display space by using area division. However, we replace a set of polygons used in SO Tree by a set of rectangles for the area division. This not only decreases the computation cost in calculating geometrical polygons, but also greatly reduces the human perceptual and cognitive loads spent on understanding the underlying hierarchical structure. We use semantic zooming technique to enlarge a particular viewing area and filter out the rest of structure that is less interested. The navigation is accommodated by animation in order to preserve the mental map."
311,Visualising file-systems using ENCCON model,"This paper describes a new approach for visualising the file structures. Our technique uses an <u>enc</u>losure + <u>con</u>nection (ENCCON) approach that provides an overall view of the entire file/directory hierarchy that gives a better understanding of the folder-folder and folder-file relationships, and therefore makes easier for the navigation. We firstly use the rectangular regions to present the folders. This allows the user to immediately percept the location, size (number of files contained) and other properties of any particular folder. To enrich the visual attributes of the file structure, we also use a node-link diagram to present the ""belonging"" relationships. This ""belonging"" relationship includes folder-folder and folder-file relationships. We use a semantic zooming technique to enlarge the display of files and folders in a particular focused area. The animation is also accommodated in order to preserve the mental map [Bartram 1997] during the navigation."
312,EncCon: An approach to constructing interactive visualization of large hierarchical data,"This paper describes a new technique called EncCon for visualizing and navigating large hierarchical information. This technique consists of two components: visualization and navigation. Visualization uses a fast enclosure+connection method to calculate the geometrical layout for the display of large hierarchies in a two-dimensional space. Our technique uses a rectangular division algorithm for recursively positioning the graph. This visualization aims to maximize the utilization of display space while retaining a good geometrical layout as well as a clear (explicit) presentation of the hierarchical structure of graphs. This paper also presents an experimental evaluation of EncCon's layout algorithm. Besides the layout algorithm, EncCon uses a new focus+context viewing technique for the navigation of large hierarchies. We use the zooming+layering concept to achieve the focus+context viewing, rather than the traditional enlarge+embedded concept, which is used by most of the available focus+context techniques. Technically, it employs semi-transparency to achieve the display of two layers of information in z-coordination at the same visualization. Both context view and detail view are drawn at two separate layers. These layers are then displayed in an overlapped manner at the same physical screen space."
313,Using visual cues on DOITree for visualizing large hierarchical data,"This paper extends a previous work on node link tree visualization and interaction by providing visual clues on hidden structures. We adopt the effectiveness of DOI Tree, a multi-focal tree layout algorithm, for exploring large hierarchical structures. The advantages of visualization are its most familiar mapping for users, its capability on providing multiple focused nodes, and its dynamic rescaling of substructures to fit the available space. By providing various methods of topological previews of substructure including simple icon view, tree view and tree map view, we provide better understanding the topology of hidden branches."
314,"Computing Voronoi Treemaps: Faster, Simpler, and Resolution-independent","Voronoi treemaps represent hierarchies as nested polygons. We here show that, contrary to the apparent popular belief, utilization of an algorithm for weighted Voronoi diagrams is not only feasible, but also more efficient than previous low-resolution approximations, even when the latter are implemented on graphics hardware. More precisely, we propose an instantiation of Lloyd's method for centroidal Voronoi diagrams with Aurenhammer's algorithm for power diagrams that yields an algorithm running in O(n*logn) rather than Omega(n*n) time per iteration, with n the number of sites. We describe its implementation and present evidence that it is faster also in practice."
315,Exploring the PieTree for Representing Numerical Hierarchical Data,This paper describes the first full implementation and evaluation of an area-based tree visualization known as the PieTree. The PieTree was first proposed in papers in 1998 and 2000 but has never been fully implemented and evaluated. Informal evaluation was used to enhance the usability of the PieTree and compare it with the more well-known TreeMap. A controlled experiment considered parallel views' effect on task performance time. There were substantial differences between kinds of tasks and in participants' styles of use. Whilst suggesting that further development of PieTrees is worthwhile the experiments underline the importance of careful task fit.
316,Circular Partitions with Applications to Visualization and Embeddings,"We introduce a hierarchical partitioning scheme of the Euclidean plane, called circular partitions. Such a partition consists of a hierarchy of convex polygons, each having small aspect ratio, and satisfying specified volume constraints. We apply these partitions to obtain a natural extension of the popular Treemap visualization method. Our proposed algorithm is not constrained in using only rectangles, and can achieve provably better guarantees on the aspect ratio of the constructed polygons. Under relaxed conditions, we can also construct circular partitions in higher-dimensional spaces. We use these relaxed partitions to obtain improved approximation algorithms for embedding ultrametrics into d-dimensional Euclidean space. In particular, we give a polylog(Delta)-approximation algorithm for embedding n-point ultrametrics into R^d with minimum distortion (Delta denotes the spread of the metric). The previously best-known approximation ratio for this problem was polynomial in n. This is the first algorithm for embedding a non-trivial family of weighted graph metrics into a space of constant dimension that achieves polylogarithmic approximation ratio."
317,Visualizing Hierarchies and Collection Structures with Fractal Trees,"This paper addresses the need for better information access to digital library collections. Without proper visualization tools, organizational and structural information is often lost or suppressed by digital library interfaces. We discuss a 2D fractal tree visualization tool that can be used to more accurately present the structure, organization and interrelation of collection metadata."
318,Embeddings of complete binary trees into grids and extended grids with total vertex-congestion 1,"Let G and H be two simple, undirected graphs. An embedding of the graph G into the graph H is an injective mapping f from the vertices of G to the vertices of H, together with a mapping which assigns to each edge [u,v] of G a path between f(u) and f(v) in H. The grid M(r,s) is the graph whose vertex set is the set of pairs on nonnegative integers, (i,j): 0<=i<r, 0<=j<s, in which there is an edge between vertices (i,j) and (k,l) if either |i-k|=1 and j=l or i=k and |j-l|=1. The extended grid EM(r,s) is the graph whose vertex set is the set of pairs on nonnegative integers, (i,j): 0<=i<r, 0<=j<s, in which there is an edge between vertices (i,j) and (k,l) if and only if |i-k|<=1 and |j-l|<=1. In this paper, we give embeddings of complete binary trees into square grids and extended grids with total vertex-congestion 1, i.e., for any vertex x of the extended grid we have load(x)+vertex-congestion(x)<=1. Depending on the parity of the height of the tree, the expansion of these embeddings is approaching 1.606 or 1.51 for grids, and 1.208 or 1.247 for extended grids."

320,Visualizing the activity of a web-based collaborative platform,"This paper describes a prototype that offers visualization features for monitoring a Web-based collaborative platform. The data displayed supports workplace awareness by providing an overview of the activities carried out on the platform. The prototype focuses on the information structured as hierarchical data. Three views are included: a classic vertical tree, a treemap view and an original new layout called ellimap. The system has been implemented on a real case in the domain of the support to innovation."
321,Innovative Visualization Tools to Monitor Scientific Cooperative Activities,"This paper describes how information visualization techniques can be used to monitor a web-based collaborative platform and to support workplace awareness by providing a global overview of the activities. An innovative prototype is described. Its originality relies on using some enclosure-based visualization methods in the context of activities monitoring, which is rather unusual. In addition, a new layout is described for representing data trees. The use of the system is illustrated with the case of a EU-funded Network of Excellence."
322,CGD -- A New Algorithm to Optimize Space Occupation in Ellimaps,"How to visualize datasets hierarchically structured is a basic issue in information visualization. Compared to the common diagrams based on the nodes-links paradigm (e.g. trees), the enclosure-based methods have shown high potential to represent simultaneously the structure of the hierarchy and the weight of nodes. In addition, these methods often support scalability up to sizes where trees become very complicated to understand. Several approaches belong to this class of visualization methods such as treemaps, ellimaps, circular treemaps or Voronoi treemaps. This paper focuses on the specific case of ellimaps in which the nodes are represented by ellipses nested one into each other. A controlled experiment has previously shown that the initial version of the ellimaps was efficient to support the perception of the dataset structure and was reasonably acceptable for the perception of the node weights. However it suffers from a major drawback in terms of display space occupation. We have tackled this issue and the paper proposes a new algorithm to draw ellimaps. It is based on successive distortions and relocations of the ellipses in order to occupy a larger proportion of the display space than the initial algorithm. A Monte-Carlo simulation has been used to evaluate the filling ratio of the display space in this new approach. The results show a significant improvement of this factor."
323,Improved Similarity Trees and their Application to Visual Data Classification,"An alternative form to multidimensional projections for the visual analysis of data represented in multidimensional spaces is the deployment of similarity trees, such as Neighbor Joining trees. They organize data objects on the visual plane emphasizing their levels of similarity with high capability of detecting and separating groups and subgroups of objects. Besides this similarity-based hierarchical data organization, some of their advantages include the ability to decrease point clutter; high precision; and a consistent view of the data set during focusing, offering a very intuitive way to view the general structure of the data set as well as to drill down to groups and subgroups of interest. Disadvantages of similarity trees based on neighbor joining strategies include their computational cost and the presence of virtual nodes that utilize too much of the visual space. This paper presents a highly improved version of the similarity tree technique. The improvements in the technique are given by two procedures. The first is a strategy that replaces virtual nodes by promoting real leaf nodes to their place, saving large portions of space in the display and maintaining the expressiveness and precision of the technique. The second improvement is an implementation that significantly accelerates the algorithm, impacting its use for larger data sets. We also illustrate the applicability of the technique in visual data mining, showing its advantages to support visual classification of data sets, with special attention to the case of image classification. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tree for analysis and iterative manipulation and employ those capabilities to support evolving to a satisfactory data organization and classification."
324,Quantitative visualizations of hierarchically organized data in a geographic context,"Here we introduce a novel quantitative technique for visualizing hierarchically organized data in a geographic context. In contrast to existing techniques, our visualization emphasizes the hierarchical relationships in the data by depicting them in a standard tree format that takes advantage of many fundamental perceptual properties. Our technique allows users to define a geographic axis and visualize how well a tree correlates with the ordering of geographical locations along this axis. This is accomplished by finding the ordering of leaf nodes, subject to the constraints of the tree topology, which minimizes the number of crossings that occur between lines that connect leaf nodes to their associated geographic locations. In this optimal layout, any crossings that occur between these lines indicate discordance between the topology of the tree and the user defined geographic axis. We have developed a branch-and-bound algorithm that allows optimal leaf orderings to be determined quickly enough to support interactive exploration of different geographic axes even for large multifurcating hierarchies. The quantitative nature of our visualization has allowed us to specify a permutation test for determining if the relationship between a tree topology and a geographic axis is statistically significant. In this paper, the utility of our visualization is demonstrated on biological data sets, but our method is applicable to any hierarchical data where geographic structure may be of interest."
325,GenGIS: A geospatial information system for genomic data,"The increasing availability of genetic sequence data associated with explicit geographic and ecological information is offering new opportunities to study the processes that shape biodiversity. The generation and testing of hypotheses using these data sets requires effective tools for mathematical and visual analysis that can integrate digital maps, ecological data, and large genetic, genomic, or metagenomic data sets. GenGIS is a free and open-source software package that supports the integration of digital map data with genetic sequences and environmental information from multiple sample sites. Essential bioinformatic and statistical tools are integrated into the software, allowing the user a wide range of analysis options for their sequence data. Data visualizations are combined with the cartographic display to yield a clear view of the relationship between geography and genomic diversity, with a particular focus on the hierarchical clustering of sites based on their similarity or phylogenetic proximity. Here we outline the features of GenGIS and demonstrate its application to georeferenced microbial metagenomic, HIV-1, and human mitochondrial DNA data sets."
326,Tracking the evolution and geographic spread of Influenza A,"The 2009 swine-origin strain of Influenza A H1N1 has spread to nearly all parts of the world, with 175 countries reporting confirmed cases thus far. Consistent with seasonal flu outbreaks, the current pandemic strain has shown rapid dispersal, with multiple examples of introduction into different geographic regions. Here we use an automated pipeline to collect data for analysis in the geospatial package GenGIS, which allows the geographic and temporal tracking of new sequence types and polymorphisms. Using this approach, we examine a pair of amino acid changes in the neuraminidase protein that are implicated in antibody recognition, and exhibit global dispersal with little or no geographic structure."
327,Visualizing Web Ontologies with CropCircles,"We apply a new visualization for complex heirarchies, CropCircles, to the interactive visualization ofWeb Ontologies and E-Connections of Web Ontologies."
328,A parent-centered radial layout algorithm for interactive graph visualization and animation,"We have developed (1) a graph visualization system that allows users to explore graphs by viewing them as a succession of spanning trees selected interactively, (2) a radial graph layout algorithm, and (3) an animation algorithm that generates meaningful visualizations and smooth transitions between graphs while minimizing edge crossings during transitions and in static layouts. Our system is similar to the radial layout system of Yee et al. (2001), but differs primarily in that each node is positioned on a coordinate system centered on its own parent rather than on a single coordinate system for all nodes. Our system is thus easy to define recursively and lends itself to parallelization. It also guarantees that layouts have many nice properties, such as: it guarantees certain edges never cross during an animation. We compared the layouts and transitions produced by our algorithms to those produced by Yee et al. Results from several experiments indicate that our system produces fewer edge crossings during transitions between graph drawings, and that the transitions more often involve changes in local scaling rather than structure. These findings suggest the system has promise as an interactive graph exploration tool in a variety of settings."
329,On the approximability of two tree drawing conventions,"We consider two aesthetic criteria for the visualization of rooted trees: inclusion and tip-over. Finding the minimum area layout according to either of these two standards is an NP-hard task, even when we restrict ourselves to binary trees. We provide a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for this problem. This result applies to any tree for tip-over layouts and to bounded degree trees in the case of the inclusion convention. We also prove that such restriction is necessary since, for unbounded degree trees, the inclusion problem is strongly NP-hard. Hence, neither a fully polynomial time approximation scheme nor a pseudopolynomial time algorithm exists, unless P=NP. Our technique, combined with the parallel algorithm by Metaxas et al., also yields an NC fully parallel approximation scheme. This latter result holds for inclusion of binary trees and for the slicing floorplanning problem. Although this problem is in P, it is unknown whether it belongs to NC or not. All the above results also apply to other size functions of the drawing (e.g., the perimeter)."
330,"SpaceTree: Supporting Exploration in Large Node Link Tree, Design Evolution and Empirical Evaluation","We present a novel tree browser that builds on the conventional node link tree diagrams. It adds dynamic rescaling of branches of the tree to best fit the available screen space, optimized camera movement, and the use of preview icons summarizing the topology of the branches that cannot be expanded. In addition, it includes integrated search and filter functions. This paper reflects on the evolution of the design and highlights the principles that emerged from it. A controlled experiment showed benefits for navigation to already previously visited nodes and estimation of overall tree topology."
331,Drawing non-layered tidy trees in linear time,"The well-known Reingoldā€“Tilford algorithm produces tidy-layered drawings of trees: drawings where all nodes at the same depth are vertically aligned. However, when nodes have varying heights, layered drawing may use more vertical space than necessary. A non-layered drawing of a tree places children at a fixed distance from the parent, thereby giving a more vertically compact drawing. Moreover, non-layered drawings can also be used to draw trees where the vertical position of each node is given, by adding dummy nodes. In this paper, we present the first linear-time algorithm for producing non-layered drawings. Our algorithm is a modification of the Reingoldā€“Tilford algorithm, but the original complexity proof of the Reingoldā€“Tilford algorithm uses an invariant that does not hold for the non-layered case. We give an alternative proof of the algorithm and its extension to non-layered drawings. To improve drawings of trees of unbounded degree, extensions to the Reingoldā€“Tilford algorithm have been proposed. These extensions also work in the non-layered case, but we show that they then cause a $O(n^2)$ run-time. We then propose a modification to these extensions that restores the $O(n)$ run-time."
332,Inclusion Tree Layout Convention: An Empirical Investigation,"The inclusion tree layout convention involves drawing trees as nested rectangles rather than the more common node-link diagrams. Finding good inclusion layouts presents some unique challenges, for example, the quantification of what is meant by the ""size"" of a rectangle. This paper empirically evaluates and investigates several rectangle size measures for their usefulness in the inclusion tree layout convention. We find that the area size measure, commonly used in graph drawing, is very poorly suited to the inclusion layout convention, whilst size measures based on the aspect ratio of the layout are more appropriate and give better results."
333,Smooth Structural Zooming of h-v Inclusion Tree Layouts,"We present a new paradigm for achieving focus+context visualizations called smooth structural zooming, which varies the level of detail of the data in different areas of the visualization, as opposed to geometrically distorting the visualization or employing rapid zooming techniques. A smooth structural zooming technique for horizontal-vertical (h-v) inclusion tree layouts is described and applied to the domain of the software design process, specifically, design behaviour trees (DBTs). This system has the ability to navigate and explore data too large to be fully displayed, whilst maintaining an approximately constant level of visual complexity, good visualization aesthetics and preservation of the user's mental map through animation. The technique may be readily extended to arbitrary layout styles and algorithms, and to other hierarchical data structures and relational information, such as clustered graphs."
334,Smooth Structural Zooming as a Tool for Navigating Large Inclusion Hierarchies,"We present a new method for achieving Focus+Context visualizations called smooth structural zooming, which varies the level of detail of the data being visualized, rather than geometrically distorting the visualization. We apply a preliminary smooth structural zooming technique to the horizontal-vertical (h-v) inclusion tree layout convention, in particular Design Behaviour Trees (DBTs). We illustrate several advantages of this system, including the ability to navigate and explore inclusion tree layout data too large to be displayed at once, keeping good layouts at all times and preserving the user's mental map with animation."
335,3D family tree visualization using Rhizome Navigation,"For an upcoming documentary by Benedikt Bjarnason, Rhizome Navigation was used to create animated visualizations of large genealogy data sets. The graph layout was done using an adapted force-directed algorithm and features more than 3300 persons. What set's it apart from similar visualizations is the capability to show far more complex relationships by breaking up the classic tree structure and following a more rhizome-like approach - and of course the sheer amount of relationships shown."
336,Tidier Drawings of Trees,"Various algorithms have been proposed for producing tidy drawings of trees - drawings that are aesthetically pleasing and use minimum drawing space. We show that these algorithms contain some difficulties that lead to aesthetically unpleasing, wider than necessary drawings. We then present a new algorithm with comparable time and storage requirements that produces tidier drawings. Generalizations to forests and m-ary trees are discussed, as are some problems in discretization when alphanumeric output devices are used."
337,The information cube: Using transparency in 3D information visualization,"In this paper, we propose a new 3D visualization technique for hierarchical information. This technique is based on the nested box metaphor, a familiar concept for any users. By using semi-transparent rendering, the system controls the complexity of the information presented to the user. With several 3D interaction techniques provided by the system, the user can recognize and inspect the information structure intuitively. Normally, the user puts on the VR equipment to use the system, but the system is also accessible through a conventional CRT display."
338,Cone Trees: Animated 3D visualizations of hierarchical information,"The task of managing and accessing large information spaces is a problem in large scale cognition. Emerging technologies for 3D visualization and interactive animation offer potential solutions to this problem, especially when the structure of the information can be visualized. We describe one of these Information Visualization techniques, called the Cone Tree, which is used for visualizing hierarchical information structures. The hierarchy is presented in 3D to maximize effective use of available screen space and enable visualization of the whole structure. Interactive animation is used to shift some of the user's cognitive load to the human perceptual system."
339,Display of hierarchical three-dimensional structures with rotating substructures,"A processor presents a sequence of images of a hierarchical structure that is perceived as three-dimensional. The hierarchical structure includes conic substructures that can have vertical or horizontal axes. Each cone has a parent node at its vertex and children nodes along its base, each with a link to the parent node. Each child can in turn be at the vertex of another cone. The cones can be rotated in steps that produce the perception of object constancy for each node. For example, if the user requests that an indicated node be moved to a primary viewing position, each of the cones along the path from the indicated node to the root node is rotated in the direction that most directly moves the indicated node to the primary viewing position. Each node can include a selectable unit for indicating it, and a node can also include a grow tab that can be selected to request presentation of its children nodes and links to them. The user can request that the children nodes of a node be replaced by a grow tab. To reduce the computation necessary for each step of rotation, the position relative to a cone's axis for each of 80 points on the base of a cone is computed for a level of the hierarchy and is then stored in an array for subsequent use in positioning nodes on that level. The base point of each node on a rotating cone can then be changed in a linked node data structure, and its new position can then be obtained by simple arithmetic operations using the axis coordinates and the appropriate data from the array. The base of each array can be a polygon whose vertices are nodes, and the base shape can be presented as a shadow to provide additional information and strengthen the perception of three dimensions. Or, the profiles of the cones can be presented as a shadow."
340,OneZoom: A Fractal Explorer for the Tree of Life,"Our knowledge of the tree of life -- a phylogenetic tree summarizing the evolutionary relationships among all life on Earth -- is expanding rapidly. ""Mega-trees"" with millions of tips (species) are expected to appear imminently. Unfortunately, there has so far been no practical and intuitive way to explore even the much smaller trees with thousands of tips that are now being routinely produced. Without a way to view megatrees, these wondrous objects, representing the culmination of decades of scientific effort, cannot be fully appreciated. The field really needs a solution to this problem to enable scientists to communicate important evolutionary concepts and data effectively, both to each other and to the general public. In this manuscript, we introduce a new approach that solves the problem. Trees with millions of tips, richly embellished with additional data, can now be easily explored within the web browser of any modern hardware with a zooming user interface similar to that used in Google Maps."
341,A new approach to visualizing general trees using thickness-adjustable quadratic curves,"We present a new algorithm for visualization of trees. This algorithm illustrates the hierarchical data by using curve segments for each edge and how edges evolve on a path from the root to the leaves. More clearly, we visualize a tree based on the shape of a botanical tree. The software tool GraphTea implements this algorithm where the adjustable thicknesses of the curve segments reflect the expansion of botanical trees. Here, we consider a simple expansion definition for each vertex as the sum over the number of children and the children of its children up to the some specific level."
342,Real-time interactive visualization of information hierarchies,"An information hierarchy is a collection of relational information that is arranged in a ranking organization where each entity is subject to a single other entity, except for the top (root) element. The usefulness of a visualization of an information hierarchy depends on its capability of conveying the information quickly and clearly. The interaction with the information hierarchy allows a user to further analyze its underlying structures and relationships, which is essential for the effectiveness of the visualization. In this paper we present a novel method to interactively visualize information hierarchies in real-time. We use the World Wide Web as an application example of our techniques. The result is a novel Web browsing and visualization method with an innovative combination of features: (i) Web data is retrieved and displayed in real-time (i.e. Web data is not pre-recorded), (ii) browsing and visualization are synchronized together in the same interface, (iii) tree-based visualization engine, and (iv) space-efficient display of visualization. Our study shows that users are able to orient themselves better in cyberspace and locate Web pages of interest faster."
343,A Practical Algorithm for Planar Straight-line Grid Drawings of General Trees with Linear Area and Arbitrary Aspect Ratio,"Trees are usually drawn using planar straight-line drawings. [2] presented an algorithm for constructing a planar straight-line grid drawing of a degree-d (general) tree with area O(n) and any pre-specified aspect ratio in the range [n^-alpha,n^alpha], where 0 <= alpha <= 1 is any constant, in O(n log n) time. Unfortunately, the algorithm of [2] is not suitable for practical use. The main problem is that the constant hidden in the ""Oh "" notation for area is quite large (for binary trees was 3900). In this paper, we have made several improvements to the algorithm, which make it suitable for practical use. We have also conducted an experiment on this newer version of the algorithm for randomly-generated general trees with up to 50,000 nodes. Our experiment shows that it constructs area-efficient drawings in practice, with area at most 19 times the number of nodes."
344,A Planar Straight-line Grid Drawing Algorithm for High Degree General Trees with User-Specified Angular Coefficient,"General trees are usually displayed as planar straight-line grid drawings which provide an easily understandable structure to the viewer. Current general tree drawing algorithms have one common problem: their drawings on high degree trees produce many small angles, which makes it difficult to distinguish edges. The algorithm we propose in this paper allows the user to provide an angular coefficient and then employs the 'best-effort-delivery' to draw edges such that the angles are above the angular coefficient. It allows the non-root nodes to place their children within a maximum of three quads of the Cartesian plane. When a node has too many children, resulting in an impossibility of achieving angles above the specified angular coefficient, our algorithm distributes all remaining children evenly among the three quads."
345,Information visualization system,"A Web browsing and visualization system and method wherein: (i) Web data is retrieved and displayed in real-time (i.e., Web data is not pre-recorded), (ii) browsing and visualization are synchronized together in the same interface, (iii) a tree-based, rings-type visualization engine, (iv) space-efficient display of visualization, and (v) the amount of resources needed from the host computer is comparatively modest. In addition, the tree-based rings engine used to create the visualization displays the information in a smaller area than previous systems. Thus, the system requires less screen space to display the same amount of information as comparable systems. Alternatively, it can display more information to the user in the same amount of screen space as comparable systems. Moreover, although the present invention is disclosed herein in connection with visualizing Web data, it can be applied to portray any information hierarchy."
346,Flexible Trees: Sketching tree layouts,"We introduce Flexible Trees, a sketch-based layout adjustment technique. Although numerous tree layout algorithms exist, these algorithms are usually bound to fit within standard shapes such as rectangles, circles and triangles. In order to provide the possibility of interactively customizing a tree layout, we offer a free-form sketch-based interaction through which one can re-define the boundary constraints for the tree layouts by combining ray-line intersection and line segment intersection. Flexible Trees offer topology preserving adjustments; can be used with a variety of tree layouts; and offer a simple way of authoring tree layouts for infographic purposes."
347,ContactTress: Ego-centeres visualization of social relations,"A topic of interest in social science research is the study of people's social contacts and activities, in which network visualization is often used to show relations among people and activities. However, network visualization is not ideal for studying individuals and comparing their social behavior and relationships with others based on data with rich attributes. In this paper, we present ContactTree, a new ego-centered visualization technique designed to reveal patterns and trends in the data, and to facilitate reasoning about patterns or trends as well as comparison of interpersonal ties and contacts. The technique is based on a botanical tree metaphor. The tree is easy to construct and the resulting tree-like visualization can display many properties of the data. We have conducted two case studies to validate our method. The first study is based on a dataset consisting of two waves of 3-month contact diaries over 2004-2008. The second study uses a co-author network consisting of mainly information visualization researchers."
348,Visualizing InfoVis Researchers with ContactTrees,"This poster presents an application of ContactTree, a new ego-centered visualization design, to charactering the collaborative activities of selected InfoVis researchers in terms of their publications as listed in DBLP. The ContactTree visualization, based on a botanical tree metaphor, is designed for studying individuals and comparing their social behavior and relationships with others based on data with rich attributes. As shown, the resulting trees give each of the selected researchers a distinct look, and many interesting patterns reveal themselves. In social science research, the study of people's social contacts and activities is of high interest. ContactTree visualization well complements conventional network visualization, which is better for showing relations among people and activities in a global context."
349,ContactTrees: A Technique for Studying Personal Network Data,"Network visualization allows a quick glance at how nodes (or actors) are connected by edges (or ties). A conventional network diagram of ""contact tree"" maps out a root and branches that represent the structure of nodes and edges, often without further specifying leaves or fruits that would have grown from small branches. By furnishing such a network structure with leaves and fruits, we reveal details about ""contacts"" in our ContactTrees that underline ties and relationships. Our elegant design employs a bottom-up approach that resembles a recent attempt to understand subjective well-being by means of a series of emotions. Such a bottom-up approach to social-network studies decomposes each tie into a series of interactions or contacts, which help deepen our understanding of the complexity embedded in a network structure. Unlike previous network visualizations, ContactTrees can highlight how relationships form and change based upon interactions among actors, and how relationships and networks vary by contact attributes. Based on a botanical tree metaphor, the design is easy to construct and the resulting tree-like visualization can display many properties at both tie and contact levels, a key ingredient missing from conventional techniques of network visualization. We first demonstrate ContactTrees using a dataset consisting of three waves of 3-month contact diaries over the 2004-2012 period, then compare ContactTrees with alternative tools and discuss how this tool can be applied to other types of datasets."
350,Contact Trees: Network Visualization beyond Nodes and Edges,"Node-Link diagrams make it possible to take a quick glance at how nodes (or actors) in a network are connected by edges (or ties). A conventional network diagram of a ""contact tree"" maps out a root and branches that represent the structure of nodes and edges, often without further specifying leaves or fruits that would have grown from small branches. By furnishing such a network structure with leaves and fruits, we reveal details about ""contacts"" in our ContactTrees upon which ties and relationships are constructed. Our elegant design employs a bottom-up approach that resembles a recent attempt to understand subjective well-being by means of a series of emotions. Such a bottom-up approach to social-network studies decomposes each tie into a series of interactions or contacts, which can help deepen our understanding of the complexity embedded in a network structure. Unlike previous network visualizations, ContactTrees highlight how relationships form and change based upon interactions among actors, as well as how relationships and networks vary by contact attributes. Based on a botanical tree metaphor, the design is easy to construct and the resulting tree-like visualization can display many properties at both tie and contact levels, thus recapturing a key ingredient missing from conventional techniques of network visualization. We demonstrate ContactTrees using data sets consisting of up to three waves of 3-month contact diaries over the 2004-2012 period, and discuss how this design can be applied to other types of datasets."
351,Hilbert Tree of Life,
352,Implementation and Evaluation of an Enhanced H-tree Layout Pedigree Visualization,"The constant growth of available genealogical information has encouraged the research of visualization techniques capable of representing the corresponding large amount of data. An H-Tree Layout has been recently proposed to represent pedigree data as a way to overcome some of the limitations of traditional representations. However, this new method has its own limitations which may hinder its adoption. In this paper, we propose some enhancements to the H-Tree Layout pedigree visualization method in order to overcome some of the identified limitations. An implementation of the proposed enhancements and results of a preliminary evaluation are also provided."
353,Extending the H-Tree Layout Pedigree: An Evaluation,"Visualizing large family structures is becoming increasingly important, as more genealogical data becomes available. A space-filling h-tree layout pedigree has been recently proposed to make better use of the available space than traditional representations. In a previous paper we applauded the technique's usage of available space but remarked that it makes generation identification difficult and does not allow navigating to descendants of represented individuals. A set of extensions was proposed to help overcome these limitations and a preliminary evaluation suggested that those extensions enhance the original technique. This paper presents a more thorough evaluation carried out to assess if and how the proposed extensions improve the original h-tree layout pedigree technique. Results suggest that these extensions improve user performance on some tasks, effectively provide new functionality, and generally enhance user experience."
354,Browsing the Web Using Stacked Three-Dimensional Sunbursts to Visualize Term Co-Occurrences and Multimedia Content,"We present a novel visualization approach that extends the Sunburst technique to the third dimension, which allows for encoding additional data in the height of each arc segment. By stacking a number of such 3D-Sunbursts, we build a user interface for browsing collections of web pages. We apply techniques for web content indexing of multimedia data (text, audio, image, video) and text analysis to create a UI where each layer of the Sunburst stack represents a specific multimedia content type. We call this user interface the Co-Occurrence Browser (COB) and demonstrate its usability on a collection of web pages related to music artists."
355,The Clustergram: A graph for visualizing hierarchical and nonhierarchical cluster analyses,"In hierarchical cluster analysis, dendrograms are used to visualize how clusters are formed. I propose an alternative graph called a “clustergram” to examine how cluster members are assigned to clusters as the number of clusters increases. This graph is useful in exploratory analysis for nonhierarchical clustering algorithms such as k-means and for hierarchical cluster algorithms when the number of observations is large enough to make dendrograms impractical. I present the Stata code and give two examples."
356,Regular TreeMap Layouts for Visual Analysis of Hierarchical Data,"Hierarchical relationships play an utmost important role in many application domains. The appropriate visualization of hierarchically structured data sets can contribute towards supporting the data analyst in effectively analyzing hierarchic structures using visualization as a user friendly means to communicate information. Information Visualization has contributed a number of useful techniques for visualization of hierarchically structured data sets. Yet, the support for certain regularity requirements as arising from many data element types has to be improved. In this paper, we analyze an existing variant of the popular TreeMap family of hierarchical layout algorithms, and we introduce a novel TreeMap algorithm supporting space efficient layout of hierarchical data sets providing global regular layouts. We detail our algorithm, and we present applications on a real-world data set as well as experiments performed on a synthetic data set, showing its applicability and usefulness."
357,The Scaffold Tree -- Visualization of the Scaffold Universe by Hierarchical Scaffold Classification,"A hierarchical classification of chemical scaffolds (molecular framework, which is obtained by pruning all terminal side chains) has been introduced. The molecular frameworks form the leaf nodes in the hierarchy trees. By an iterative removal of rings, scaffolds forming the higher levels in the hierarchy tree are obtained. Prioritization rules ensure that less characteristic, peripheral rings are removed first. All scaffolds in the hierarchy tree are well-defined chemical entities making the classification chemically intuitive. The classification is deterministic, data-set-independent, and scales linearly with the number of compounds included in the data set. The application of the classification is demonstrated on two data sets extracted from the PubChem database, namely, pyruvate kinase binders and a collection of pesticides. The examples shown demonstrate that the classification procedure handles robustly synthetic structures and natural products."
358,A Point-Based Layout for Large Hierarchies,"Space-filling layout techniques for tree representations are frequently used when the available screen space is small or the data set is large. In this paper, we propose a new approach to space-filling tree representations, which uses mechanisms from the point-based rendering paradigm. We also numerically evaluate our new technique together with two established space-filling techniques using the measures of the Ink-Paper-Ratio and overplotted%."
359,Point-based tree representation: A new approach for large hierarchies,"Space-filling layout techniques for tree representations are frequently used when the available screen space is small or the data set is large. In this paper, we propose a new approach to space-filling tree representations, which uses mechanisms from the point-based rendering paradigm. Additionally, helpful interaction techniques that tie in with our layout are presented. We will relate our new technique to established space-filling techniques along the lines of a newly developed classification and also evaluate it numerically using the measures of the Ink-Paper-Ratio and overplotted%."
360,The Design Space of Implicit Hierarchy Visualization: A Survey,"Apart from explicit, node-link representations, implicit visualizations and especially the Treemap as their frontrunner have acquired a solid position among the available techniques to visualize hierarchies. Their advantage is an extremely space-efficient graphical representation that does not require explicit drawing of edges. In this paper, we survey the design space for this class of visualization techniques. For that purpose, we first establish the design space along the four axes of dimensionality, edge representation, node representation, and layout by examining most of the existing implicit hierarchy visualization techniques. The survey is completed by an outlook to the so far unexplored regions of the design space by giving a few examples of novel combinations of design parameters. Furthermore, we ensure that our design space is not a mere theoretical construct, but a practically usable tool for rapid visualization development by discussing and presenting a concrete software implementation of the introduced design space."
361,Point-Based Visualization for Large Hierarchies,"Space-filling layout techniques for tree representations are frequently used when the available screen space is small or the data set is large. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to space-filling tree representations, which uses mechanisms from the point-based rendering paradigm. We relate this new layout approach to common layout mechanisms and present helpful interaction techniques that tie in with our layout. Additionally, we compare and contrast the new layout with established space-filling techniques in a preliminary user study and along the lines of a numerical evaluation using the measures of the Ink-Paper-Ratio and overplotted%. The flexibility of the general approach is illustrated by several enhancements of the basic layout, as well as its usage within the context of two software frameworks from different application fields."
362,A Generative Layout Approach for Rooted Tree Drawings,"In response to the large number of existing tree layouts, generic ``meta-layouts'' have recently been proposed. These generic approaches utilize layout design spaces to pinpoint a tree drawing with desired characteristics in the wealth of available drawing options and parameters. While design-space-based generic layouts work well for the confined set of implicit space-filling tree layouts, they have so far eluded their extension to explicit node-link diagrams. In order to produce both, implicit and explicit tree layouts, this paper parts with the descriptive nature of the design spaces and instead takes a generative approach based on operators. As these operators can be combined into operator sequences and be used at different stages of the layout process, a small operator set already suffices to yield a large number of different tree layouts. To this end, we present a generic tree layout pipeline and give examples of suitable layout operators to plug into the pipeline. A prototypical implementation of our pipeline and operators is presented, and it is illustrated with space-filling and node-link examples. Furthermore, the paper presents results from a user study evaluating our generative approach as it is realized by the prototype."
363,"Analytical, visual and interactive concepts for geo-visual analytics","Supporting the visual analysis of structured multivariate geo-spatial data is a challenging task involving many different aspects. In this paper, we describe a systematic view of this task based on Chi's data state reference model. The analytical, visual and interaction components of the systematic view will be instantiated with specific examples that demonstrate how their tight interconnection facilitates exploration and analysis of geo-spatial data. In particular, we address the visualization of hierarchical structures on maps applying an extended focus+context concept. Moreover, we introduce an approach to extracting association rules from geo-spatial data and visualizing them on maps."

365,Tablorer -- An Interactive Tree Visualization System for Tablet PCs,"A variety of mobile devices are available today, but there is no dominant tree visualization system in the devices. This paper proposes Tablorer, a novel interactive tree visualization system for medium-sized mobile devices, especially for tablet PCs. The system shows the hierarchical information with a compact way using an expandable table format. For efficient navigation, the system provides an integrated view of context and focus information. The experimental results show that Tablorer can reduce the search time by about 22%."
366,Tree visualization with tree-maps: 2-d space-filling approach,"This paper presents a novel approach to representing trees that have weights or sizes on the leaf nodes. The 2-d visualization is space filling and the recursive algorithm for generation runs rapidly. It depends on color coding (or shading) of regions and easily provides users with a quick overview that clearly indicates relative sizes of the leaf nodes. Figures 3 and 4 show examples of tree-maps with size coding, as implemented by Brian Johnson on an Apple Macintosh II computer with a high resolution color display. Figure 3 shows fifteen files in four directories at three levels, with nested boxes to show the levels. Figure 4 represents actual disk directories encompassing 850 files at four levels with color coding by file type (text, graphics, applications, etc.). We continue to explore refinements of tree-maps such as alternate layouts, better methods for coping with large ranges of file size, color coding schemes and operations applied to files."
367,Ordered Treemap Layouts,"Treemaps, a space-filling method of visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms have been proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, and fail to preserve an ordering of the underlying data. This paper introduces the ordered treemap, which addresses these two shortcomings. The ordered treemap algorithm ensures that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials, we show that compared to other layout algorithms ordered treemaps are more stable while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A second test set uses stock market data."
368,TreeJuxtaposer InfoVis Contest Entry,"TreeJuxtaposer is a tool for interactive side-by-side tree comparison. Its two key innovations are the automatic marking of topological structural differences, and the guaranteed visibility of marked items. It uses the AccordionDrawer approach for layout and navigation, a multifocus global Focus+Context approach where stretching one part of the tree or screen causes the rest to shrink, and vice versa. Progressive rendering guarantees immediate interactive response even for large trees."
369,PRISAD: A partitioned rendering infrastructure for scalable accordion drawing,"We present PRISAD, the first generic rendering infrastructure for information visualization applications that use the accordion drawing technique: rubber sheet navigation with guaranteed visibility for marked areas of interest. Our new rendering algorithms are based on the partitioning of screen space, which allows us to handle dense dataset regions correctly. The algorithms in previous work led to incorrect visual representations because of overculling, and to inefficiencies due to overdrawing multiple items in the same region. Our pixel based drawing infrastructure guarantees correctness by eliminating overculling, and improves rendering performance with tight bounds on overdrawing. PRITree and PRISeq are applications built on PRISAD, with the feature sets of TreeJuxtaposer and SequenceJuxtaposer, respectively. We describe our PRITree and PRISeq dataset traversal algorithms, which are used for efficient rendering, culling, and layout of datasets within the PRISAD framework. We also discuss PRITree node marking techniques, which offer order-of-magnitude improvements to both memory and time performance versus previous range storage and retrieval techniques. Our PRITree implementation features a five fold increase in rendering speed for nontrivial tree structures, and also reduces memory requirements in some real world datasets by up to eight times, so we are able to handle trees of several million nodes. PRISeq renders fifteen times faster and handles datasets twenty times larger than previous work."

371,Using Treemaps for variable selection in spatio-temporal visualisation,"We demonstrate and reflect upon the use of enhanced treemaps that incorporate spatial and temporal ordering for exploring a large multivariate spatio-temporal data set. The resulting data-dense views summarise and simultaneously present hundreds of space-, time-, and variable-constrained subsets of a large multivariate data set in a structure that facilitates their meaningful comparison and supports visual analysis. Interactive techniques allow localised patterns to be explored and subsets of interest selected and compared with the spatial aggregate. Spatial variation is considered through interactive raster maps and high-resolution local road maps. The techniques are developed in the context of 42.2 million records of vehicular activity in a 98 sqkm area of central London and informally evaluated through a design used in the exploratory visualisation of this data set. The main advantages of our technique are the means to simultaneously display hundreds of summaries of the data and to interactively browse hundreds of variable combinations with ordering and symbolism that are consistent and appropriate for space- and time-based variables. These capabilities are difficult to achieve in the case of spatio-temporal data with categorical attributes using existing geovisualisation methods. We acknowledge limitations in the treemap representation but enhance the cognitive plausibility of this popular layout through our two-dimensional ordering algorithm and interactions. Patterns that are expected (e.g. more traffic in central London), interesting (e.g. the spatial and temporal distribution of particular vehicle types) and anomalous (e.g. low speeds on particular road sections) are detected at various scales and locations using the approach. In many cases, anomalies identify biases that may have implications for future use of the data set for analyses and applications. Ordered treemaps appear to have potential as interactive interfaces for variable selection in spatio-temporal visualisation."
372,Rectangular Hierarchical Cartograms for Socio-Economic Data,"We present rectangular hierarchical cartograms for mapping socio-economic data. These density-normalising cartograms size spatial units by population, increasing the ease with which data for densely populated areas can be visually resolved compared to more conventional cartographic projections. Their hierarchical nature enables the study of spatial granularity in spatial hierarchies, hierarchical categorical data and multivariate data through false hierarchies. They are space-filling representations that make efficient use of space and their rectangular nature (which aims to be as square as possible) improves the ability to compare the sizes (therefore population) of geographical units. We demonstrate these cartograms by mapping the Office for National Statistics Output Area Classification (OAC) by unit postcode (1.52 million in Great Britain) through the postcode hierarchy, using these to explore spatial variation. We provide rich and detailed spatial summaries of socio-economic characteristics of population as types of treemap, exploring the effects of reconfiguring them to study spatial and non-spatial aspects of the OAC classification."
373,Readable Layout of Unbalanced N-ary Trees,"The automatic layout of unbounded n-ary tree structures is a problem of subjectively meshing two independent goals: clarity and space efficiency. This paper presents a minimal set of subjective aesthetics which insures highly readable structures, without overly restricted flexibility in the layout of the tree. This flexibility underlies the algorithm's ability to produce readable trees with greater uniformity of node density throughout the display than achieved by previous algorithms, an especially useful characteristic where nodes are labelled with text."
374,Stable Treemaps via Local Moves,"Treemaps are a popular tool to visualize hierarchical data: items are represented by nested rectangles and the area of each rectangle corresponds to the data being visualized for this item. The visual quality of a treemap is commonly measured via the aspect ratio of the rectangles. If the data changes, then a second important quality criterion is the stability of the treemap: how much does the treemap change as the data changes. We present a novel stable treemapping algorithm that has very high visual quality. Whereas existing treemapping algorithms generally recompute the treemap every time the input changes, our algorithm changes the layout of the treemap using only local modifications. This approach not only gives us direct control over stability, but it also allows us to use a larger set of possible layouts, thus provably resulting in treemaps of higher visual quality compared to existing algorithms. We further prove that we can reach all possible treemap layouts using only our local modifications. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure for stability that better captures the relative positions of rectangles. We finally show via experiments on real-world data that our algorithm outperforms existing treemapping algorithms also in practice on either visual quality and/or stability. Our algorithm scores high on stability regardless of whether we use an existing stability measure or our new measure."
375,FlexTree: Visualising large quantities of hierarchical information,"Visualising large quantities of hierarchical information is a difficult topic in information visualisation and it has been attracting much effort since the emergence of this research area. The paper presents the FlexTree, an approach to visualising, navigating and analysing large hierarchies. It is based on the focus+context technique and combines the power of the histogram with traditional two dimensional (2D) node-link diagrams. This approach maintains the context of a large hierarchy while providing easy and consistent access to details of multiple focal points. Simple aesthetic rules and an interactive design were applied to the system. As a demonstration of the approach a computer file system hierarchy with 6,351 file folders and 130,400 files on a personal computer has been successfully visualised."
376,Multiple foci visualisation of large hierarchies with FlexTree,"One of the main tasks in information visualisation research is creating visual tools to facilitate human understanding of large and complex information spaces. Hierarchies, being a good mechanism for organising such information, are ubiquitous. Although much research effort has been spent on finding useful representations for hierarchies, visualising large hierarchies is still a difficult topic. One of the difficulties is how to handle the ever increasing scale of hierarchies. Another is how to enable the user to focus on multiple selections of interest while maintaining context. This paper describes a hierarchy visualisation technique called FlexTree to address these problems. It contains some important features that have not been exploited so far. A profile or contour unique to the hierarchy being visualised can be viewed in a bar chart layout. A normalised view of a common attribute of all nodes can be selected by the user. Multiple foci are consistently accessible within a global context through interaction. Furthermore it can handle a large hierarchy that contains 10,000 nodes in a PC environment. This technique has been applied to visualise computer file system structures and decision trees from data mining results. The results from informal user evaluations against these two applications are also presented. User feedback suggests that FlexTree is suitable for visualising large decision trees."
377,LensTree: Browsing and Navigating Large Hierarchical Information Structures,"This paper presents LensTree, a novel browsing and navigation tool for large hierarchical information structures. It enhances traditional indented lists by applying focus+context view to its design. LensTree dynamically changes the sizes of nodes to provide a focal area around the mouse pointer while keeping nodes in the peripheral area in smaller sizes as context. This enables it to display a larger hierarchy than traditional indented lists within the same screen area. Therefore scrolling and expanding/collapsing are less often used so that it is more efficient for performing browsing and navigation tasks. An informal user test was conducted and the users showed strong interest to LensTree's visual presentation. It suggested that this technique was worth further exploitation."
378,A comparative evaluation on tree visualization methods for hierarchical structures with large fan-outs,"Hierarchical structures with large fan-outs are hard to browse and understand. In the conventional node-link tree visualization, the screen quickly becomes overcrowded as users open nodes that have too many child nodes to fit in one screen. To address this problem, we propose two extensions to the conventional node-link tree visualization: a list view with a scrollbar and a multi-column interface. We compared them against the conventional tree visualization interface in a user study. Results show that users are able to browse and understand the tree structure faster with the multi-column interface than the other two interfaces. Overall, they also liked the multi-column better than others."
379,Rectangular Tree Browser: a Navigation and Visualization Tool for Large Hierarchies,"Hierarchies, also known as trees, is a good means to manage information. Therefore handling hierarchical data structures becomes an important task in the field of information visualization. Focus+context concept is a well-known strategy to cope with the representation of large collections of data. This concept has been applied to many tools for visualizing large hierarchies, such as Hyperbolic Browser, SpaceTree, DOI Tree, etc. Despite the success of these tools, they could not adequately utilize the display space. We propose a technique named Rectangular Tree Browser for the visualization and navigation of large hierarchies. The technique lays out the tree on an imaginary geometrical plane with the root in the center, and then transforms and maps the plane to a limited rectangle area rather than an ellipse area as Hyperbolic Browser does. Comparing with Hyperbolic Browser, our browser makes better use of the display space. Moreover, because regular user interface components are rectangular, by doing this transformation, the browser is easy to be integrated into a user interface that contains more components. We conducted an informal user test with five users performing navigation and selection tasks. Through observation and interview, we found that our users didn't experience any uncomfortability. We believe that Rectangular Tree Browser has the potential to be a good tool for navigation and visualization of large hierarchies."
380,"Focus+Context Display and Navigation Techniques for Enhancing Radial, Space-Filling Hierarchy Visualizations","Radial, space-filling visualizations can be useful for depicting information hierarchies, but they suffer from one major problem. As the hierarchy grows in size, many items become small, peripheral slices that are difficult to distinguish. We have developed three visualization/interaction techniques that provide flexible browsing of the display. The techniques allow viewers to examine the small items in detail while providing context within the entire information hierarchy. Additionally, smooth transitions between views help users maintain orientation within the complete information space."
381,An evaluation of space-filling information visualizations for depicting hierarchical structures,"A variety of information visualization tools have been developed recently, but relatively little effort has been made to evaluate the effectiveness and utility of the tools. This article describes results from two empirical studies of two visualization tools for depicting hierarchies, in particular, computer file and directory structures. The two tools examined implement space-filling methodologies, one rectangular, the Treemap method, and one circular, the Sunburst method. Participants performed typical file/directory search and analysis tasks using the two tools. In general, performance trends favored the Sunburst tool with respect to correct task performance, particularly on initial use. Performance with Treemap tended to improve over time and use, suggesting a greater learning cost that was partially recouped over time. Each tool afforded somewhat different search strategies, which also appeared to influence performance. Finally, participants strongly preferred the Sunburst tool, citing better ability to convey structure and hierarchy."
382,Representing development history in software cities,In this paper we describe a systematic approach to utilize the city metaphor for the visualization of large software systems as evolving software cities. The main contribution is a new layout approach which explicitly takes the development history of software systems into account and makes history directly visible in the layouts. These layouts incrementally evolve in a very smooth and stable way during the development of the represented software system. They are used as a visualization platform for integrating a large variety of product and process data and thus create a coherent set of specialized visualizations. To illustrate this we present some example maps capturing specific development history aspects.
383,Understanding software evolution with software cities,"Software cities are visualizations of software systems in the form of virtual cities. They are used as platforms to integrate a large variety of product- and process-related analysis data. Their usability, however, for real-world software development often suffers from their inability to appropriately deal with software changes. Even small structural changes can disrupt the overall structure of the city, which in turn corrupts the mental maps of its users. In this article we describe a systematic approach to utilize the city metaphor for the visualization of evolving software systems as growing software cities. The main contribution is a new layout approach which explicitly takes the development history of software systems into account. The approach has two important effects: first, it creates a stable gestalt of software cities even when the underlying software systems evolve; thus, by preserving its users’ mental maps these cities are especially suitable for use during ongoing system development. Second, it makes history directly visible in the city layouts, which allows for supporting novel analysis scenarios. We illustrate such scenarios by presenting several thematic cities’ maps, each capturing specific development history aspects."
384,Optimal orientations of cells in slicing floorplan designs,"A methodology of VLSI layout described by several authors first determines the relative positions of indivisible pieces, called cells, on the chip. Various optimizations are then performed on this initial layout to minimize some cost measure such as chip area or perimeter. If each cell is a rectangle with given dimensions, one optimization problem is to choose orientations of all the cells to minimize the cost measure. A polynomial time algorithm is given for this optimization problem for layouts of a special type called slicings. However, orientation optimization for more general layouts is shown to be NP-complete (in the strong sense)."
385,Method and apparatus for displaying data within a three-dimensional information landscape,A method and apparatus are presented for displaying three-dimensional navigable display space containing an aggregation of graphical objects and an overview of the aggregation of display objects. An altered perspective is provided by compressing the horizontal dimension of the displayed objects so that a user can see a representative overview of the entire aggregation of display objects that have been selected for display together on a display screen. The compressed component is expanded so that the objects appear wider as a navigator approaches the displayed objects. A spotlight shines down on objects responsive to a data query. The spotlight serves as a navigation aid to the navigator so that highlighted items are visible from a distance and can be easily located. The user's view of the display space is altered so that the navigator perceives that he is traveling in a straight line when approaching a display object in a display space in which the horizontal dimension of displayed objects is compressed in accordance with the apparent distance between a displayed object and the navigator.
386,Method and apparatus for navigation within three-dimensional information landscape,"A method and apparatus for navigating within a three dimensional graphic display space and manipulating information and data represented by objects in display space. The method and apparatus presents users with a vastly expanded view of their data, displayed with a richer dimensionality. Data objects represented by graphic objects are arranged into a navigable landscape representing the containership and contextual relations of the underlying data. The graphic objects are columns, pedestals and disks, which represent data blocks, cells, and comparative values respectively. The columns rest on the pedestals. The disks are located with respect to the top of the column to signify a comparative attribute. The pedestal rest upon a ground plane. The ground plane represents a threshold value. Data attributes may be represented by visual, textual, executable, or audible characteristics of the display. The user may interact with the data to affect change in the underlying data or its representation within the display space. Less detail is displayed as the user navigates away from objects within the display space. Objects change from three-dimensional to two-dimensional, to line segments as the user moves away from the objects. Visible attributes such as text and icons are not displayed for distant objects."
387,Fast Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps,"The Voronoi Treemap is a space-filling treemap technique that relaxes the constraints of rectangular nodes. Its organic shapes maintain a one-to-one aspect ratio, are flexible with their placement, allowing stable zooming and dynamic data values. In this paper, we present algorithms for efficient computation and dynamic update of Voronoi Treemaps. Our GPGPU-based technique allows for rapid computation of centroidal Voronoi Diagrams, providing almost two orders of magnitude speedup over previous work. In addition, we present a hierarchical algorithm for stable updates. Finally, we demonstrate the application of Voronoi treemaps to real-world dynamic datasets, including interactive navigation."
388,Nested Pie Chart,"A pie chart divides a circle or ellipse into slices, where the size and color of each slice is based on some attributes of the elements it represents. For example, one can show the constituents of a stock porfolio in a pie-chart, where each slice will be occupied by one stock and the size of the slice will be decided by the total value of the portfolio, and the color determined by percentage price change. A Nested Pie Chart extends the functionality of a pie-chart by adding letting it represent a tree data model, thus making it a elliptical heatmap."
389,A Low Complexity Recursive Force-Directed Tree Layout Algorithm Based on the Lennard-Jones Potential,"In this paper, a low complexity force-directed tree layout algorithm based on the Lennard-Jones potential is described. The recursive method lays out sub-trees as small disks contained in their parent disk. Inside each disk, children disks are dynamically laid out using a new force directed simulation. Unlike most other force directed layout methods which run in quadratic time for each simulation step, this algorithm runs in O(n**(m+1)/m) time per each step for a tree with n nodes, depth m and all the nodes having uniform number of children. The layout uses space efficiently and reflects both global structure and local detail. The method supports runtime insertion and deletion. Both operations and the evolving process are rendered with smooth animation to preserve visual continuity. The method could be used to monitor in real time, visualize and analyze a wide variety of data which has a rooted tree structure, e.g. internet hosts could be laid out by domain name (DNS) hierarchies. This paper gives a description of the algorithm, a complexity analysis and an example of how the algorithm is implemented to visualize DNS tree."
390,FROTH -- A force-directed representation of tree hierarchies,"FROTH is the implementation of a low complexity force-directed tree layout algorithm based on the Lennard-Jones potential. The recursive method lays out sub-trees as small disks contained in their parent disk. Inside each disk, children disks are dynamically laid out using a new force directed simulation. Unlike most other force-directed layout methods which run in quadratic time for each simulation step, this algorithm runs in $O(n^m+1/m)$ time per each step for a tree with $n$ nodes, depth $m$ and all the nodes having uniform number of children. The layout uses space efficiently and reflects both global structure and local detail. The method supports runtime insertion and deletion. Both operations and the evolving process are rendered with smooth animation to preserve visual continuity. The method could be used to monitor in real time, visualize and analyze a wide variety of data which has a rooted tree structure, e.g. internet hosts could be laid out by domain name (DNS) hierarchies."
391,Enhanced spatial stability with Hilbert and Moore Treemaps,"Treemaps are a well known and powerful space-filling visualisation method for displaying hierarchical data. Many alternative treemap algorithms have been proposed, often with the aim being to optimise performance across several criteria, including spatial stability to assist users in locating and monitoring items of interest. In this paper we demonstrate that spatial stability is not fully captured by the commonly used `distance change' metric, and we introduce a new `location drift' metric to more fully capture spatial stability. An empirical study examines the validity and usefulness of the location drift metric, showing that it explains some effects on user performance that distance change does not. Next, we introduce `Hilbert' and `Moore' treemap algorithms, which are designed to achieve high spatial stability. We assess their performance in comparison to other treemaps, showing that Hilbert and Moore treemaps perform well across all stability metrics."
392,AdaptiviTree: Adaptive Tree Visualization for Tournament-Style Brackets,"Online pick'em games, such as the recent NCAA college basketball March Madness tournament, form a large and rapidly growing industry. In these games, players make predictions on a tournament bracket that defines which competitors play each other and how they proceed toward a single champion. Throughout the course of the tournament, players monitor the brackets to track progress and to compare predictions made by multiple players. This is often a complex sense making task. The classic bracket visualization was designed for use on paper and utilizes an incrementally additive system in which the winner of each match-up is rewritten in the next round as the tournament progresses. Unfortunately, this representation requires a significant amount of space and makes it relatively difficult to get a quick overview of the tournament state since competitors take arbitrary paths through the static bracket. In this paper, we present AdaptiviTree, a novel visualization that adaptively deforms the representation of the tree and uses its shape to convey outcome information. AdaptiviTree not only provides a more compact and understandable representation, but also allows overlays that display predictions as well as other statistics. We describe results from a lab study we conducted to explore the efficacy of AdaptiviTree, as well as from a deployment of the system in a recent real-world sports tournament."
393,Adaptive tree visualization for tournament-style brackets,"An adaptive tree visualization system and method for adaptively deforming a traditional bracket tree to visualize information about competitors in a linear manner. A one-dimensional result line emanates from the name of each competitor such that the progress of each competitor can be immediately determined by examining the length of the competitor's result line. The result line typically is composed of multiple result line segments. Each line segment spans a particular time period column to indicate that the competitor is matched up with another competitor during that time period. A pending result line segment spans the adjacent time period to indicate that the results of the match-up are unknown. Once the result of the match-up is known, the pending result line is added to the result line segment of the winning competitor. This extends the winner's result line into the next time period while the loser's result line remains unchanged."
394,Treecube: Visualization Tool for Browsing 3D Multimedia Data,"This paper proposes a new 3D visualization tool for hierarchical information. A 2D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treemap has already been proposed by Ben Shneiderman, et al. in 1992. In general, hierarchical information is represented as a tree structure. Treemap hierarchically lays out each node as a bounding box, whose size is the same as the specific weight or attribute value of the node. After the original treemap algorithm called slice-and-dice, some extensions to it have been proposed: squarified treemap, ordered treemap and strip treemap. Furthermore, quantum treemap is a quantization version of these extensions. In this paper, the authors propose a new 3D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treecube that can be taken as a 3D extension of treemap. Especially, this paper shows its usefulness for browsing 3D multimedia data, i.e., 2D images, 3D shape models, motion data, etc., originally stored in a file system."
395,Interactive Interfaces of Treecube for Browsing 3D Multimedia Data,"The authors of this paper have already proposed Treecube which is a visualization tool for browsing 3D multimedia data. In this paper, the authors also propose its interactive interfaces for efficiently browsing 3D multimedia data. Treecube is regarded as a 3D extension of treemap, which is a visualization tool for hierarchical information proposed by Ben Shneiderman et al. in 1992. For treemap, there are several layout algorithms: slice-and-dice, ordered treemap, strip treemap and so on. Furthermore, quantum treemap exists. It means a quantization version of these treemap layout algorithms. The authors implemented mainly three layout algorithms, i.e., slice-and-dice, ordered and strip treecube algorithm, and implemented their quantization version. Practically sophisticated interfaces are necessary for efficiently browsing 3D multimedia data. In this paper, the authors also propose such interfaces. The authors implemented mainly five interface functionalities for the following operations. (1) ""Cutting plane"" concept to solve the occlusion problem, i.e., nodes located before the plane are hidden to make it easy to see inside nodes. (2) The control of node frames, i.e., their brightness and thickness, for easily understanding the hierarchical structure of nodes. (3) Standard operations for the translation and the rotation of an eye position, and for the zoom in/out. (4) Particular operations for the extraction of the user focus node and for the backward/forward for browsing such node. The authors also implemented (5) a function to assign color information to any node properties because color is the most important factor of the visual display properties."
396,Visualizing Time-Dependent Data in Multivariate Hierarchic Plots -- Design and Evaluation of an Economic Application,"For successfully competing in a modern economy, large amounts of hierarchic time-dependent data need to be analyzed. As an example, one could consider the geographic composition of inflation in the European Union, or the revenue by product (sub) categories of a firm in the last month. Analysts wish to interpret the structure of the data not only at a single point in time, but examine the changes in the data categories through time. The analysts may need to consider additional dimensions to composition and time, such as the growth rate or profit rate. To reflect such analytic requirements, we have developed an interactive visualization of multi-dimensional, structured data taking the time dimension into account. The data are displayed in a three dimensional hierarchic circular or column plot. The time dimension of the data is represented by animation. Our system provides interactive tools for the visual data analysis and variable set-up of the data display. For better orientation in the data space, we have enhanced the visualization with smooth transitions between different data selections in case of 3D hierarchic plots. The techniques presented can be applied to various data domains. A user study using European inflation data has shown the usefulness for effective economic analysis."
397,Data Quality Visualization for Multivariate Hierarchic Data,"In many business applications, decision makers often have to base their decisions on large amounts of data from various sources. Often, the quality of this data varies substantially, affecting the degree of certainty the analyst can put into the analyzed data values. The data quality measures may be of qualitative or quantitative nature, and consist of one or many dimensions. In this poster paper, we first present a brief survey of currently available uncertainty visualization techniques. We then present experimental results we obtained with several techniques for visualization of multidimensional data quality information, applied on multivariate hierarchic data used in an economic data analysis scenario."
398,Combining extended Table Lens and Treemap techniques for visualizing tabular data,"We present a framework for visualizing large tabular data that combines two views: the table view and the treemap view. The table view extends the known table lens as follows: We cluster related elements to reduce subsampling artifacts and achieve table size independent rendering time; we use multiple-column sorting to create scenariospecific data hierarchies on the fly; and we use shaded cushions to show data structure and variation. Hierarchies built in the table view are shown in a customizable treemap view. One can choose both layout and rendering by a few clicks, effectively creating visual scenarios on-the-fly. We illustrate our framework on real-life stock data."
399,RINGS: A Technique for Visualizing Large Hierarchies,"We present RINGS, a technique for visualizing large trees. We introduce a new ringed circular layout of nodes to make more efficient use of limited display space. RINGS provides the user with the means to specify areas of primary andsecond ary focus, andis able to show multiple foci without compromising understanding of the graph. The strength of RINGS is its ability to show more area in focus andmore contextual information than existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RINGS by applying it to the visualization of a Unix file directory."
400,"PaintingClass: Interactive construction, visualization and exploration of decision trees","Decision trees are commonly used for classification. We propose to use decision trees not just for classification but also for the wider purpose of knowledge discovery, because visualizing the decision tree can reveal much valuable information in the data. We introduce PaintingClass, a system for interactive construction, visualization and exploration of decision trees. PaintingClass provides an intuitive layout and convenient navigation of the decision tree. PaintingClass also provides the user the means to interactively construct the decision tree. Each node in the decision tree is displayed as a visual projection of the data. Through actual examples and comparison with other classification methods, we show that the user can effectively use PaintingClass to construct a decision tree and explore the decision tree to gain additional knowledge."
401,FSN: The 3D file system navigator,
402,"Method, system, and computer program product for visualizing data using partial hierarchies","A method, system, and computer program product provides data visualization which optimizes visualization of and navigation through hierarchies. A partial hierarchy is generated and displayed. The partial hierarchy consists of a number levels at least equal to a predetermined depth and less than a total number of levels included in a corresponding complete hierarchy. Parent nodes in the bottom level of the partial hierarchy have segments of connection lines extending toward child nodes not included in the partial hierarchy. A user is permitted to mark selected nodes or locations in a displayed partial hierarchy. Partial hierarchies are generated and stored in a cache or generated on-the-fly. Each partial hierarchy ends at a progressively deeper level. An interpolator interpolates a partial hierarchy layout by interpolating corresponding nodes in two partial hierarchies. A hierarchy manager manages partial hierarchies in response to requests from a viewer to move a camera to camera positions. Partial hierarchies are fetched from the cache or the interpolator. A display then displays display views of fetched partial hierarchies corresponding to the camera positions. During free-form navigation, a hierarchy manager determines and maintain an orientation based on at least one reference object. During zooming, an angular orientation is maintained through successive partial hierarchies. Mapping is also provided between a three-dimensional 3D partial hierarchy and a two-dimensional 2D overview of a complete hierarchy."
403,Method of generating and navigating a 3-D representation of a hierarchical data structure,"A method of generating a graphical representation of a hierarchical data structure to on a display unit, the hierarchical data structure including a first node having at least one content item. A graphic tree representative of the hierarchical data structure is displayed on the display unit, the graphic tree including a first graphic representation of the first node. A second graphic representation, associated with the first graphic representation, that provides a representation of a content item (e.g., a file) is displayed on the display unit, the second graphic representation differing in appearance from the first graphic representation."
404,Treemap display with minimum cell size,"A treemap with cells that have a minimum size so that large data sets can be clearly represented. A treemap that represents a plurality of data elements is generated, the treemap including a plurality of two-dimensional cells. Each cell represents a corresponding data element in the data set. The treemap includes a portion of a display screen assigned to a first cell so that the first cell has a size. A portion of the display screen is then assigned to a subsequent cell. The size of the first cell is adjusted in order to compensate for a size of the subsequent cell and to maintain the minimum cell size."
405,Kaleidoscope visualization of fine-grain parallel programs,"A software visualization tool is described that transforms program execution trace data from a multiprocessor into a single, color image. The image is essentially the program's logical procedure-invocation tree, displayed radially from the root. An algorithm is described that condenses the image both radially and laterally, producing a color-dense abstraction of the program's execution behavior: a program signature, within a workstation window. An implementation of the tool was made in X-Windows, including a user interface that can zoom the image and annotate any node in the image with the corresponding procedure-invocation data. Experimentation with the system was performed with trace data from Panda, a concurrent logic programming system on shared-memory multiprocessors. The authors demonstrate how the tool helps the programmer develop intuitions about parallel performance and how condensation successfully abstracts very large traces."
406,Fisheye Tree Views and Lenses for Graph Visualization,"We present interactive visual aids to support the exploration and navigation of graph layouts. They include fisheye tree views and composite lenses. These views provide, in an integrated manner, overview+detail and focus+context. Fisheye tree views are novel applications of the well known fisheye distortion technique. They facilitate the exploration of the hierarchy trees associated with clustered graphs. Composite lenses are the result of the integration of several lens techniques. They facilitate the display of local graph information that may be otherwise difficult to grasp in large and dense graph layouts"
407,Circular Tree Drawing by simulating network synchronisation dynamics and scaling,We present an algorithm which produces circular-shape layouts of trees by simulating synchronisation dynamics on the tree. Our approach consists of evolving scalar dynamical values assigned to the nodes. Then the dissimilarities between the values of each pair of nodes are utilised to calculate the coordinates of the nodes by using a lower bound on dissimilarities and scaling up the lower bound per iteration.
408,Interactive Rendering of Complex 3D-Treemaps,"3D-Treemaps are an important visualization technique for hierarchical views. In contrast to 2D-Treemaps, height can be used to map one additional attribute of the data items. Using the Treemap technique in combination with large datasets (more than 500k) a fast rendering and interaction techniques that are beyond collapsing/uncollapsing nodes is still one of the main challenges. This paper presents a novel rendering technique that enables the image synthesis of geometrical complex 3D-Treemaps in real-time. The fully hardware accelerated approach is based on shape generation using geometry shaders. This approach offers increased rendering performance and low update latency compared to existing techniques and through it enables new real-time interaction techniques to large datasets."
409,HierarchyMap: A Novel Approach to Treemap Visualization of Hierarchical Data,"The HierarchyMap describes a novel approach for Treemap Visualization method for representing large volume of hierarchical information on a 2-dimensional space. HierarchyMap algorithm is a new ordered treemap algorithm. Results of the implementation of HierarchyMap treemap algorithm show that it is capable of representing several thousands of hierarchical data on 2-dimensional space on a computer and Portable Device Application (PDA) screens while still maintaining the qualities found in existing treemap algorithms such as readability, low aspect ratio, reduced run time, and reduced number of thin rectangles. The HierarchyMap treemap algorithm is implemented in Java programming language and tested with dataset of Departmental and Faculty systems of Universities, Family trees, Plant and Animal taxonomy structures."
410,Trevis: A context tree visualization and analysis framework and its use for classifying performance failure reports,"When developers profile their applications to identify performance problems, they normally use profilers producing calling context trees. A calling context tree (CCT) represents the caller-callee relationships of a program. A dynamically collected CCT provides method coverage information. The CCTs produced by profilers also include method hotness information. Trevis, our context tree visualization and analysis framework, allows users to visualize, compare, cluster, and intersect CCTs produced by profilers. We evaluate Trevis in the context of a novel profiling tool called FlyBy. FlyBy runs transparently on an end-user's computer and continuously samples the applications' call stack. When the user perceives the application as sluggish, she presses a ""Was Slow!"" button to tell FlyBy to file a performance failure report. The report contains the CCT based on the call stack samples FlyBy gathered over the last few seconds before the user pressed the button. We show how Trevis allows us to visualize and classify FlyBy bug reports."
411,Navigation techniques for 2.5D graph layout,"In this paper, we consider the problem of navigating graphs drawn in 2.5 dimensions. First, we define criteria for good navigation and then present various methods to satisfy some of the criteria. In particular, we design and implement methods for trees, clustered graphs and hierarchical graphs drawn in 2.5 dimensions."
412,Efficient planar embedding of trees for VLSI layouts,"The use of planar polygonal partitioning schemes for planar embedding of tree structures is examined. Two layout designs based on recursive square and triangular decompositions are described for trees having branching factors of k*k and k*k-1, where k is an integer. The former design allocates the same amount of area to nodes at all levels and requires a total area linear in the number N of nodes in the tree. The latter design assigns increasing area to nodes closer to the root and requires a total area of O[N(k*k/(k*k-1))logN]. The longest interconnection has a length of O(sqrt(Area(N))) in each case."
413,The hype over Hyperbolic Browsers,"Considers complaints about the usability in the human-computer interaction aspect of information retrieval and discusses information visualization, the Online Library of Information Visualization Environments, hyperbolic information structure, subject searching, real-world applications, relational databases and hyperbolic trees, and the future of visual information structures."
414,Information Pyramidstexttrademark: A New Approach to Visualising Large Hierarchies,"This paper presents work in progress on a new technique for visualising and manipulating large hierarchies. The Information Pyramids approach compactly visualises hierarchical structures in three dimensions using pyramid-like structures, which grow upwards as the hierarchy is descended. The technique is described in the context of our early experience with a prototype file system visualiser based on Information Pyramids."
415,"Information Slices: Visualising and Exploring Large Hierarchies using Cascading, Semi-Circular Discs",This paper presents work in progress on a new technique for visualising and manipulating large hierarchies. The information slices approach compactly visualises hierarchical structures using a series of semi-circular discs. The technique is described in the context of our early experience with a prototype file system visualiser based on information slices.
416,The InfoSky visual explorer: Exploiting hierarchical structure and document similarities,"InfoSky is a system enabling users to explore large, hierarchically structured document collections. Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. Documents of similar content are placed close to each other and are visualised as stars, forming clusters with distinct shapes. For greater performance, the hierarchical structure is exploited and force-directed placement is applied recursively at each level on much fewer objects, rather than on the whole corpus. Collections of documents at a particular level in the hierarchy are visualised with bounding polygons using a modified weighted Voronoi diagram. Their area is related to the number of documents contained. Textual labels are displayed dynamically during navigation, adjusting to the visualisation content. Navigation is animated and provides a seamless zooming transition between summary and detail view. Users can map metadata such as document size or age to attributes of the visualisation such as colour and luminance. Queries can be made and matching documents or collections are highlighted. Formative usability testing is ongoing; a small baseline experiment comparing the telescope browser to a tree browser is discussed."
417,Visual Exploration of Large Hierarchies with Information Pyramids,"Information pyramids compactly visualise large hierarchical structures in three dimensions using pyramid-like structures, which grow upwards as the hierarchy deepens. A plateau represents the root of the tree; other, smaller plateaus arranged on top of it represent its subtrees. Separate glyphs are used to represent leaf nodes such as files or documents and navigational facilities are provided for interactive exploration. Two generations of information pyramids prototype are described and discussed."
418,Visualising Large Hierarchically Structured Document Repositories with InfoSky,"InfoSky is an interactive system for the exploration of large, hierarchically structured document collections. InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification like a real-world telescope. The hierarchical structure is reflected using recursive subdivision into Voronoi polygons. At each level of the hierarchy documents and subcollections are positioned according to the similarity of their content using a force-directed placement technique. Documents are assumed to have significant textual content, which can be extracted with specialised tools. The hierarchical structure is exploited for greater performance. Force-directed placement is applied recursively at each level on the objects at that level rather than on the whole corpus."
419,The visualisation of large hierarchical document spaces with InfoSky,"It is no longer unusual for large document collections to contain many millions of documents. In order to manage this size of repository, it is often essential to structure the repository according to a thematic classification hierarchy. InfoSky is a system enabling users to explore such large, hierarchically structured document collections. Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. The hierarchical structure is represented by recursive Voronoi subdivision of the available space. At each level, larger subcollections are assigned more space and related subcollections gravitate towards one another. Individual documents at each level of the hierarchy are represented by stars placed according to their similarity. Finally, InfoSky extracts and displays descriptors describing the essential theme of each subcollection at each level of the hierarchy."
420,ControlTree: Navigating and Selecting in a Large Tree,"We introduce ControlTree, a novel interface using crossing interaction to navigate and select nodes in a large tree. ControlTree combines an optimized dynamic layout with interaction features to quickly reach a node in a node-link tree representation."
421,Naviguer dans des grands arbres avec ControlTree,"This article presents ControlTree, a relevant technique to select a node is a very large node-link representation using a continuous interaction. The node-link representation is dynamic and driven by the cursor location to optimize screen space and to ease the selections. ControlTree uses a snapping mechanism and adapts the OrthoZoom technique to offer an alternative to common ""point-and-click"" techniques. We also present a preliminary theoretical evaluation showing that ControlTree is a promising technique."
422,Method and system for generating a Columnar Tree Map,"A method and system to generate a columnar tree map of a hierarchical structure is provided. An example system comprises a memory, at least one processor coupled to the memory, a data access module configured to access a hierarchical data structure, and a tree map generator to generate a tree map using at least one processor. The tree map generator generates and renders a tree map for a target data set based on the size and dimensions of a viewing area provided on a target display device, the values associated with categories in the data set, and a predetermined column width."
423,Navigable visualization of a hierarchical data structure,"An example system generates, for a target data set, a navigable space based upon quantitatively-visualized menus. The navigable space is provided within a viewing area on a display device and comprises a stacked bar chart at the left end of a viewing area and, on the right end of the viewing area, a bar graph comprising set of bars. The stacked bar chart is also usable as an actionable menu."
424,GosperMap: Using a Gosper curve for laying out hierarchical data,"The emergence of very large hierarchies that result from the increase in available data raises many problems of visualization and navigation. On data sets of such scale, classical graph drawing methods do not take advantage of certain human cognitive skills such as shape recognition. These cognitive skills could make it easier to remember the global structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a method that is based on the use of nested irregular shapes. We name it GosperMap as we rely on the use of a Gosper Curve to generate these shapes. By employing human perception mechanisms that were developed by handling, for example, cartographic maps, this technique facilitates the visualization and navigation of a hierarchy. An algorithm has been designed to preserve region containment according to the hierarchy and to set the leaves' sizes proportionally to a property, in such a way that the size of nonleaf regions corresponds to the sum of their children's sizes. Moreover, the input ordering of the hierarchy's nodes is preserved, i.e., the areas that represent two consecutive children of a node in the hierarchy are adjacent to one another. This property is especially useful because it guarantees some stability in our algorithm. We illustrate our technique by providing visualization examples of the repartition of tax money in the US over time. Furthermore, we validate the use of the GosperMap in a professional documentation context and show the stability and ease of memorization for this type of map."
425,Visualizing the structure of large trees,"This study introduces a new method of visualizing complex tree structured objects. The usefulness of this method is illustrated in the context of detecting unexpected features in a data set of very large trees. The major contribution is a novel two-dimensional graphical representation of each tree, with a covariate coded by color. The motivating data set contains three dimensional representations of brain artery systems of 105 subjects. Due to inaccuracies inherent in the medical imaging techniques, issues with the reconstruction algo- rithms and inconsistencies introduced by manual adjustment, various discrepancies are present in the data. The proposed representation enables quick visual detection of the most common discrepancies. For our driving example, this tool led to the modification of 10% of the artery trees and deletion of 6.7%. The benefits of our cleaning method are demonstrated through a statistical hypothesis test on the effects of aging on vessel structure. The data cleaning resulted in improved significance levels."

427,Drawing Phylogenetic Trees,"We present linear-time algorithms for drawing phylogenetic trees in radial and circular representations. In radial drawings given edge lengths (representing evolutionary distances) are preserved, but labels (names of taxons represented in the leaves) need to be adjusted, whereas in circular drawings labels are perfectly spread out, but edge lengths adjusted. Our algorithms produce drawings that are unique solutions to reasonable criteria and assign to each subtree a wedge of its own. The linear running time is particularly interesting in the circular case, because our approach is a special case of Tutte's barycentric layout algorithm involving the solution of a system of linear equations."
428,Tree Drawings on the Hexagonal Grid,"We consider straight-line drawings of trees on a hexagonal grid. The hexagonal grid is an extension of the common grid with inner nodes of degree six. We restrict the number of directions used for the edges from each node to its children from one to five, and to five patterns: straight, Y, psi, X, and full. The psi-drawings generalize hv- or strictly upward drawings to ternary trees. We show that complete ternary trees have a psi-drawing on a square of size and general ternary trees can be drawn within area. Both bounds are optimal. Sub-quadratic bounds are also obtained for X-pattern drawings of complete tetra trees, and for full-pattern drawings of complete penta trees, which are 4-ary and 5-ary trees. These results parallel and complement the ones of Frati for straight-line orthogonal drawings of ternary trees. Moreover, we provide an algorithm for compacted straight-line drawings of penta trees on the hexagonal grid, such that the direction of the edges from a node to its children is given by our patterns and these edges have the same length. However, drawing trees on a hexagonal grid within a prescribed area or with unit length edges is NP-hard."
429,How to draw free trees inside bounded simple polygons,"In this paper we investigate polyline grid drawing of free trees on 2D grids which are bounded by simple polygons. We focus on achieving uniform node distribution while we also try to achieve minimum edge crossings. We do not consider achieving symmetry as a mandatory task, but our algorithm can exploit some symmetries present in both the given trees and the given polygons. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt for developing algorithms that draw graphs on regions which are bounded by simple polygons."
430,Space-filling Software Visualization,"SeeSys is a system embodying a technique for visualizing statistics associated with code that is divided hierarchically into subsystems, directories and files. This technique can display the relative sizes of the components in the system, the relative stability of the components, the location of new functionality and the location of error-prone code with many bug fixes. Using animation, it can display the historical evolution of the code. Applying this technique, the source code from a multi-million line production software product is visualized."
431,Hierarchy based 3D Visualization of Large Software Structures,Modern object-oriented programs are hierarchical systems with many thousands of interrelated subsystems. Visualization helps developers to better comprehend these large and complex systems. This work presents a three-dimensional visualization technique that represents the static structure of object-oriented software using distributions of three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane. The visual complexity is reduced by adjusting the transparency of object surfaces to the distance of the viewpoint. An approach called Hierarchical Net is proposed for a clear representation of the relationships between the subsystems.
432,Voronoi Treemaps,"Treemaps are a well known method for the visualization of attributed hierarchical data. Previously proposed treemap layout algorithms are limited to rectangular shapes, which cause problems with the aspect ratio of the rectangles as well as with identifying the visualized hierarchical structure. The approach of Voronoi treemaps presented in this paper eliminates these problems through enabling subdivisions of and in polygons. Additionally, this allows for creating treemap visualizations within areas of arbitrary shape, such as triangles and circles, thereby enabling a more flexible adaptation of treemaps for a wider range of applications."
433,PygmyBrowse: A small screen tree browser,"We present PygmyBrowse, a browser that allows users to navigate a tree data structure in a limited amount of display space. A pilot evaluation of PygmyBrowse was conducted, and results suggest that it reduces task completion times and increases user satisfaction over two alternative node-link tree browsers."

435,"A generic algorithm for sequential, rectangular, space filling layouts","We present a generic algorithm to sequentially pave a rectangular area with smaller, fixed-surface, rectangles. The parameters of this algorithm are functional, and it covers the full design space considered. This class of layouts is interesting, because it includes all kinds of treemaps involving the placement of rectangles. For instance, Slice and dice, Squarified, Strip and Pivot layouts are obtained through various formulations of two simple chunking and phrasing functions. Some new and potentially interesting layouts which can be generated using our algorithm are introduced, such as spiral treemaps and data dependent variations of known layout strategies."
436,Capturing the Design Space of Sequential Space-Filling Layouts,"We characterize the design space of the algorithms that sequentially tile a rectangular area with smaller, fixed-surface, rectangles. This space consist of five independent dimensions: Order, Size, Score, Recurse and Phrase. Each of these dimensions describe a particular aspect of such layout tasks. This class of layouts is interesting, because, beyond encompassing simple grids, tables and trees, it also includes all kinds of treemaps involving the placement of rectangles. For instance, Slice and dice, Squarified, Strip and Pivot layouts are various points in this five dimensional space. Many classic statistics visualizations, such as 100% stacked bar charts, mosaic plots and dimensional stacking, are also instances of this class. A few new and potentially interesting points in this space are introduced, such as spiral treemaps and variations on the strip layout. The core algorithm is implemented as a JavaScript prototype that can be used as a layout component in a variety of InfoViz toolkits."
437,Cheops: A Compact Explorer For Complex Hierarchies,"As the amount of electronic information explodes, hierarchies to handle this information become huge and complex. Visualizing and interacting with these hierarchies become daunting tasks. The problem is exacerbated if the visualization is to be done on massmarket personal computers, with limited processing power and visual resolution. Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for hierarchies of 1000 nodes. But as the number of nodes increases toward 5000 nodes, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above 5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering, which can affect visual stability. This paper introduces Cheops, a novel approach to the representation, browsing and exploration of huge, complex information hierarchies such as the Dewey Decimal system, which can contain between 1 million and 1 billion nodes. The Cheops approach maintains context within a huge hierarchy, while simultaneously providing easy access to details. This paper will also present some preliminary results from usability tests performed on an 8 wide by 9 deep classification hierarchy, which if fully populated would contain over 19 million nodes."
438,Generalized Pythagoras Trees for Visualizing Hierarchies,"Pythagoras Trees are fractals that can be used to depict binary hierarchies. But this binary encoding is an obstacle for visualizing hierarchical data such as file systems or phylogenetic trees, which branch into n subhierarchies. Although any hierarchy can be modeled as a binary one by subsequently dividing n-ary branches into a sequence of n-1 binary branches, we follow a different strategy. In our approach extending Pythagoras Trees to arbitrarily branching trees, we only need a single visual element for an n-ary branch instead of spreading the binary branches along a strand. Each vertex in the hierarchy is visualized as a rectangle sized according to a metric. We analyze several visual parameters such as length, width, order, and color of the nodes against the use of different metrics. The usefulness of our technique is illustrated by two case studies visualizing directory structures and a large phylogenetic tree. We compare our approach with existing tree diagrams and discuss questions of geometry, perception, readability, and aesthetics."
439,Generalized Pythagoras Trees: A fractal approach to hierarchy visualization,"Through their recursive definition, many fractals have an inherent hierarchical structure. An example are binary branching Pythagoras Trees. By stopping the recursion in certain branches, a binary hierarchy can be encoded and visualized. But this binary encoding is an obstacle for representing general hierarchical data such as file systems or phylogenetic trees, which usually branch into more than two subhierarchies. We hence extend Pythagoras Trees to arbitrarily branching trees by adapting the geometry of the original fractal approach. Each vertex in the hierarchy is visualized as a rectangle sized according to a metric. We analyze several visual parameters such as length, width, order, and color of the nodes against the use of different metrics. Interactions help to zoom, browse, and filter the hierarchy. The usefulness of our technique is illustrated by two case studies visualizing directory structures and a large phylogenetic tree. We compare our approach with existing tree diagrams and discuss questions of geometry, perception, readability, and aesthetics."
440,PhotoMesa: A Zoomable Image Browser Using Quantum Treemaps and Bubblemaps,"PhotoMesa is a zoomable image browser that uses a novel treemap algorithm to present large numbers of images grouped by directory, or other available metadata. It uses a new interaction technique for zoomable user interfaces designed for novices and family use that makes it straightforward to navigate through the space of images, and impossible to get lost. PhotoMesa groups images using one of two new algorithms that lay out groups of objects in a 2D space-filling manner. Quantum treemaps are designed for laying out images or other objects of indivisible (quantum) size. They are a variation on existing treemap algorithms in that they guarantee that every generated rectangle will have a width and height that are an integral multiple of an input object size. Bubblemaps also fill space with groups of quantum-sized objects, but generate non-rectangular blobs, and utilize space more efficiently."
441,Ordered and quantum treemaps: Making effective use of 2D space to display hierarchies,"Treemaps, a space-filling method for visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms have been previously proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, fail to preserve order of the underlying data, and create layouts that are difficult to visually search. In addition, continuous treemap algorithms are not suitable for displaying fixed-sized objects within them, such as images.This paper introduces a new ""strip"" treemap algorithm which addresses these shortcomings, and analyzes other ""pivot"" algorithms we recently developed showing the trade-offs between them. These ordered treemap algorithms ensure that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials and from actual stock market data, we show that, compared to other layout algorithms, ordered treemaps are more stable, while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A user study with 20 participants clarifies the human performance benefits of the new algorithms. Finally, we present quantum treemap algorithms, which modify the layout of the continuous treemap algorithms to generate rectangles that are integral multiples of an input object size. The quantum treemap algorithm has been applied to PhotoMesa, an application that supports browsing of large numbers of images."
442,"Scalable, Robust Visualization of Very Large Trees","The TreeJuxtaposer system allowed visual comparison of large trees with guaranteed visibility of landmarks and Focus+Context navigation. While that system allowed exploration and comparison of larger datasets than previous work, it was limited to a single tree of 775,000 nodes by a large memory footprint. In this paper, we describe the theoretical limitations to TreeJuxtaposer's architecture that severely restrict its scalability. We provide two scalable, robust solutions to these limitations: TJC and TJC-Q. TJC is a system that supports browsing trees up to 15 million nodes by exploiting leading-edge graphics hardware while TJC-Q allows browsing trees up to 5 million nodes on commodity platforms. Both of these systems use a fast new algorithm for drawing and culling and benefit from a complete redesign of all data structures for more efficient memory usage and reduced preprocessing time."
443,Three-dimensional embedding of binary trees,"We describe total congestion 1 embeddings of complete binary trees into three dimensional grids with expansion ratios 1.172 and 1.25. That is, we give a one-to-one embedding of any complete binary tree into a hexahedron shaped grid such that: the number of nodes in the grid is at most 1.172 (1.25) times the number of nodes in the tree; and no tree nodes or edges occupy the same grid positions. The first strategy embeds trees into cube shaped 3D grids. That is, 3D grids in which all dimensions are roughly equal in size. The second strategy embeds trees into flat 3D grid shapes. That is, it maps complete binary trees into 3D grids with a fixed, small number of layers. An application suggests which embedding to use. For simulations in parallel computer environments, or possibly graph drawing, a cube shaped 3D grid is appropriate. For the sake of VLSI, or other graph drawing applications, embeddings with a small number of layers are better."
444,Embedding a complete binary tree into a three-dimensional grid,"We describe total congestion 1 embeddings of complete binary trees into three dimensional grids with low expansion ratio r. That is, we give a one-to-one embedding of any complete binary tree into a hexahedron shaped grid such that (a) the number of nodes in the grid is at most r times the number of nodes in the tree, and (b) no tree nodes or edges occupy the same grid positions. The first strategy embeds trees into cube shaped 3D grids. That is, 3D grids in which all dimensions are roughly equal in size, and which thus have no limit in the number of layers. The technique uses a recursive scheme, and we obtain an expansion ratio of r=1.09375. We then give strategies which embed trees into flat 3D grid shapes. That is, we map complete binary trees into 3D grids with a fixed, small number of layers k. Using again a recursive scheme, for k=2, we obtain r=1.25. By a rather different technique, which intricately weaves the branches of various subtrees into each other, we are able to obtain very tight embeddings: We have r=1.171875 for embeddings into five layer grids and r=1.09375 for embeddings into seven layer grids."
445,Using Orthographic Projection and Animation to Convey Treemap Structure,"We present an alternative treemap visualization method that maintains the space-filling and area comparison benefits of the standard treemap while improving the range of possible comparisons and the clarity of the hierarchy. Our visualization uses an orthographic stack representation and relies on interaction and animation to reveal the structure of the treemap to the user, but is still effective in a static environment once the user reaches a view that interests them."
446,Method and apparatus for the viewing and exploration of the content of hierarchical information,"A method and system are disclosed for displaying a graphical representation on a display screen of a data processing system in a manner that optimizes screen ""real estate"" and ease of information viewing. The graphical representation may be a tree hierarchy including a plurality of expandable and collapsible nodes. The method begins as the hierarchy is displayed within a primary display window on the display screen when the user selects a node to be expanded . In response, a first display region is output within the primary display window and includes a set of one or more subnodes associated with the selected node. If a first subnode in the first display region is then selected for expansion, a second display region is then output within the first display region, and the second display region in turn includes a set of one or more subnodes of the first subnode. This generation of new ""nested"" display regions then continues as the user continues to explore deeper into the tree hierarchy. A given subnode display region may have one or more controls, such as a sizing button or one or more scroll bars, to facilitate display of node information within the region, and preferably each expanded node remains associated with its subnode display region using a guideline. If generation and display of a subnode display region requires additional screen space, one or more of the subnodes in the ""parent"" display region are re-positioned."
447,Treemaps with Bounded Aspect Ratio,"Treemaps are a popular technique to visualize hierarchical data. The input is a weighted tree T where the weight of each node is the sum of the weights of its children. A treemap for T is a hierarchical partition of a rectangle into simply connected regions, usually rectangles. Each region represents a node of T and its area is proportional to the weight of the corresponding node. An important quality criterion for treemaps is the aspect ratio of its regions. One cannot bound the aspect ratio if the regions are restricted to be rectangles. In contrast, polygonal partitions, that use convex polygons, can have bounded aspect ratio. We are the first to obtain convex partitions with optimal aspect ratio O(depth(T)) . However, depth(T) still depends on the input tree. Hence we introduce a new type of treemaps, namely orthoconvex treemaps, where regions representing leaves are rectangles, L-, and S-shapes, and regions representing internal nodes are orthoconvex polygons. We prove that any input tree, irrespective of the weights of the nodes and the depth of the tree, admits an orthoconvex treemap of constant aspect ratio."
448,Treemaps with Bounded Aspect Ratio,"Treemaps are a popular technique to visualize hierarchical data. The input is a weighted tree $tree$ where the weight of each node is the sum of the weights of its children. A treemap for $tree$ is a hierarchical partition of a rectangle into simply connected regions, usually rectangles. Each region represents a node of $tree$ and the area of each region is proportional to the weight of the corresponding node. An important quality criterium for treemaps is the aspect ratio of its regions. Unfortunately, one cannot bound the aspect ratio if the regions are restricted to be rectangles. Hence Onak and Sidiropoulos in SoCG 2008 introduced polygonal partitions, which use convex polygons. We are the first to obtain convex partitions with optimal aspect ratio $O(depth(tree))$. Furthermore, we consider rectilinear partitions, which retain more of the schematized flavor of standard rectangular treemaps. Our rectilinear treemaps have constant aspect ratio, independent of $depth(tree)$ or the number and weight of the nodes. The leaves of $tree$ are represented by rectangles, L-, and S-shapes and internal nodes by orthoconvex polygons. We also consider the important special case that $depth(tree)=1$, that is, single-level treemaps. We prove that it is strongly NP-hard to minimize the aspect ratio of a rectangular single-level treemap. On the positive side we show how to construct rectilinear and convex single-level treemaps with constant aspect ratio. Our rectilinear single-level treemaps use only rectangles and L-shapes and have aspect ratio at most $2 + 2 3/3$. The convex version uses four different octilinear shapes and has aspect ratio at most 9/2."
449,Convex Treemaps with Bounded Aspect Ratio,"Treemaps are a popular technique to visualize hierarchical data. The input is a weighted tree T where the weight of each node is the sum of the weights of its children. A treemap for T is a hierarchical partition of a rectangle into simply connected regions, usually rectangles. Each region represents a node of T and the area of each region is proportional to the weight of the corresponding node. An important quality criterium for treemaps is the aspect ratio of its regions. Unfortunately, one cannot bound the aspect ratio if the regions are restricted to be rectangles. Hence Onak and Sidiropoulos introduced polygonal partitions, which use convex polygons. We are the first to obtain convex partitions with optimal aspect ratio O(depth(T)). We also consider the important special case that depth(T)=1, that is, single-level treemaps. We show how to construct convex single-level treemaps that use only four simple shapes for the regions and have aspect ratio at most 34/7."
450,Fat Polygonal Partitions with Applications to Visualization and Embeddings,"Let T be a rooted and weighted tree, where the weight of any node is equal to the sum of the weights of its children. The popular Treemap algorithm visualizes such a tree as a hierarchical partition of a square into rectangles, where the area of the rectangle corresponding to any node in T is equal to the weight of that node. The aspect ratio of the rectangles in such a rectangular partition necessarily depends on the weights and can become arbitrarily high. We introduce a new hierarchical partition scheme, called a polygonal partition, which uses convex polygons rather than just rectangles. We present two methods for constructing polygonal partitions, both having guarantees on the worst-case aspect ratio of the constructed polygons; in particular, both methods guarantee a bound on the aspect ratio that is independent of the weights of the nodes. We also consider rectangular partitions with slack, where the areas of the rectangles may differ slightly from the weights of the corresponding nodes. We show that this makes it possible to obtain partitions with constant aspect ratio. This result generalizes to hyper-rectangular partitions in $R^d$. We use these partitions with slack for embedding ultrametrics into d-dimensional Euclidean space: we give a polylog(delta)-approximation algorithm for embedding n-point ultrametrics into $R^d$ with minimum distortion, where delta denotes the spread of the metric. The previously best-known approximation ratio for this problem was polynomial in n. This is the first algorithm for embedding a non-trivial family of weighted-graph metrics into a space of constant dimension that achieves polylogarithmic approximation ratio."
451,Visualizing Gene Expression Data via Voronoi Treemaps,We investigate the use of Voronoi Treemaps to visualize complex biological data from gene expression analysis in conjunction with hierarchical classifications like Gene Ontology or KEGG Orthology.
452,xps -- Dynamic Process Tree Watching Under X,"The xps program dynamically displays the Unix processes as a tree or forest in an X Window, the roots on the left and the leaf processes (those with no children) on the right. The status of each process running, sleeping, stopped, etc., can be indicated by different colors. Different users can appear as different colors too. Process selection can be made per user, all users, or through a regular-expression pattern. In contrast to the terminal-based pstree or tree-widget based programs, the tree display uses diagonal lines, and effort is made to effectively use the full 2-dimensional area of the screen by balancing levels and centering the children of a node between their parent. A goal of the program is to give an idea of what's going on graphically as things may be constantly changing. Therefore the display algorithm tries to keep processes close to their parents to reduce the amount of scrolling to see localized process creation and destruction. Some effort is also given to make sure that the tree layout doesn't get wildly reorganized when there are small or localized changes. This makes it easier for the eye to pick up and recognize the changes over a potentially large display area. We describe here criteria for tree animations such as this one and how the xps layout algorithm works. There are some other miscellaneous features of xps. One can select viewing the processes by a single user, a regular expression for users, by all users, and perhaps show kernel processes. One can click on a process to get more information (via ps or a user-specified program) about that process, send a signal, or set the process priority, assuming you have the permission to do so. Since programs of this ilk can consume a bit of CPU on their own, some effort has been made to turn off the update process when the program is iconified or not visible for some other reason such as being obscured by another window. Some attention has been paid to make algorithm display fairly fast in most situations, although it has to be admitted that this comes sometimes at the expense of a nicer layout."
453,"Semiologie graphique. Les diagrammes, les reseaux, les cartes","Jacques Bertin a joue un role majeur dans l'evolution des conceptions graphiques et cartographiques. Semiologie graphique est l'un de ses ouvrages incontournables, plusieurs fois reedite et traduit en anglais. Cette nouvelle edition propose une carte hors texte offrant une vision saisissante du relief de la France. Elle comporte egalement des mises au point originales de Jacques Bertin et constitue une synthese de ses demarches. Semiologie graphique apporte une reponse objective aux deux questions suivantes: dans quel cas faut-il faire un dessin? Quel dessin faut-il faire? La semiologie graphique remplace l'inventaire classique des formules graphiques par une analyse des moyens et des buts et par un ensemble de regles imperatives qui commandent la redaction graphique, c'est-a-dire le choix des correspondances entre les sensibilites visuelles disponibles et les elements de l'information."
454,Graphics and Graphic Information Processing,
455,"Semiology of graphics: Diagrams, networks, maps","Originally published in French in 1967, Semiology of Graphics is internationally recognized as a foundational work in the fields of design and cartography. Based on Jacques Bertin's practical experience as a cartographer, part one of this work is an unprecedented attempt to synthesize principles of graphic communication with the logic of standard rules applied to writing and topography. Part two brings Bertin's theory to life, presenting a close study of graphic techniques, including shape, orientation, color, texture, volume, and size, in an array of more than 1,000 maps and diagrams. Now, with a new epilogue written by the author shortly before his death, this new 2010 edition in English reawakens us to the information design possibilities of modern technology. Jacques Bertin was a French cartographer and theorist, and a world renowned authority on the subject of information visualization. In 1954, he founded the Cartographic Laboratory of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, and in 1957 he was named director of education. In 1967, Bertin became a professor at the Sorbonne, and in 1974 he was appointed director of education and director of the Geographical Laboratory of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. In the late 1970s, he became head of research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique."
456,Improving Layout Quality by Mixing Treemap-Layouts Based on Data-Change Characteristics,"This paper presents a hybrid treemap layout approach that optimizes layout-quality metrics by combining state-of-the-art treemap layout algorithms. It utilizes machine learning to predict those metrics based on data metrics describing the characteristics and changes of the dataset. For this, the proposed approach uses a neural network which is trained on artificially generated dataset,s containing a total of 15.8 million samples. The resulting model is integrated into an approach called Smart- Layouting. This approach is evaluated on real-world data from 100 publicly available software repositories. Compared to other state-of-the-art treemap algorithms it reaches an overall better result. Additionally, this approach can be customized by an end user's needs. The customization allows for specifying weights for the importance of each layout-quality metric. The results indicate, that the algorithm is able to adapt successfully towards a given set of weights."
457,Recursive binary tree layout mixing,"Binary tree layout with adequate boundary-I/O has been approached by mixing the H-layout and standard layout patterns. This paper proposes a recursive method of mixing these two tree layout patterns. Unlike the existing technique (of using a single continuous stretch of H-layout and then standard layout for the remaining tree levels), we propose to mix these two layout styles in a finer grain. The finer grain mixed pattern is then repeated to obtain an overall tree layout. This approach offers an order of area improvement over the existing single stretch layout mixing approaches, while retaining identical boundary-I/O. This makes the proposed approach an order of magnitude superior to the existing techniques."
458,Stacked trees: a new hybrid visualization method,"In this paper, we introduce a new Focus+Context visualization technique, named ``Stacked Trees'', allowing us to explore large dendrograms produced by hierarchical clustering. This approach displays up to fifty thousands nodes on a standard-sized screen."
459,Improving Visualization of Large Hierarchical Clustering,"The classical representation of a binary tree generated by a hierarchical clustering is a node-link-based visualization denoted as a dendrogram. It allows users to explore in a simple way the clusters and the relationships between instances. However, exploration of large dendrograms is known to be difficult due to the graphical and cognitive information overload involved. Here, we discuss the current approaches and we introduce Stacked Trees, a new Focus+Context visualization technique that allows the exploration of the hierarchical clustering of up to fifty thousands nodes on a standard-sized screen."
460,Extending Tree-Maps to Three Dimensions: A Comparative Study,"This paper presents StepTree, an information visualization tool designed for depicting hierarchies, such as directory structures. StepTree is similar to the hierarchy-visualization tool, Treemap, in that it uses a rectangular, space-filling methodology, but differs from Treemap in that it employs three-dimensional space, which is used to more clearly convey the structural relationships of the hierarchy. The paper includes an empirical study comparing typical search and analysis tasks using StepTree and Treemap. The study shows that users perform significantly better on tasks related to interpreting structural relationships when using StepTree. In addition, users achieved the same performance with StepTree and Treemap when doing a range of other common interpretative and navigational tasks."
461,The effect of animated transitions on user navigation in 3D Tree-maps,"This paper describes a user study conducted to evaluate the use of smooth animated transitions between directories in a three-dimensional, tree-map visualization. We looked specifically at the task of returning to a previously visited directory after either an animated or instantaneous return to the root location. The results of the study show that animation is a double-edged sword. Even though users take more shortcuts, they also make more severe navigational errors. It seems as though the promise of a more direct route to the target directory, which animation provides, somehow precludes users who navigate incorrectly from applying a successful recovery strategy."
462,Navigation Techniques for Zoomable Treemaps,This paper presents a new technique called zoomable treemaps that makes it possible to navigate in very large trees. It integrates several efficient interaction techniques that enable multi-scale and structure-aware navigation.
463,Browsing Zoomable Treemaps: Structure-Aware Multi-Scale Navigation Techniques,"Treemaps provide an interesting solution for representing hierarchical data. However, most studies have mainly focused on layout algorithms and paid limited attention to the interaction with treemaps. This makes it difficult to explore large data sets and to get access to details, especially to those related to the leaves of the trees. We propose the notion of zoomable treemaps (ZTMs), an hybridization between treemaps and zoomable user interfaces that facilitates the navigation in large hierarchical data sets. By providing a consistent set of interaction techniques, ZTMs make it possible for users to browse through very large data sets (e.g., 700,000 nodes dispatched amongst 13 levels). These techniques use the structure of the displayed data to guide the interaction and provide a way to improve interactive navigation in treemaps."
464,Treemaps zoomables: techniques d'interaction multi-'echelles pour les treemaps,"Some efficient visualizations (such as treemaps) have been proposed for trees, but the interaction they provide to explore and acces data is often poor, especially for very large trees. We have designed a consistent set of navigation techniques that makes it possible to use treemaps as zoomable interfaces. We introduce structure-aware navigation, the property of using the structure of the displayed information to guide navigation, property that our interaction techniques share."
465,Dendrogramix: A hybrid tree-matrix visualization technique to support interactive exploration of dendrograms,"Clustering is often a first step when trying to make sense of a large data set. A wide family of cluster analysis algorithms, namely hierarchical clustering algorithms, does not provide a partition of the data set but a hierarchy of clusters organized in a binary tree, known as a dendrogram. The dendrogram has a classical node-link representation used by experts for various tasks like: to decide which subtrees are actual clusters (e.g., by cutting the dendrogram at a given depth); to give those clusters a name by inspecting their content; etc. We present Dendrogramix, a hybrid tree-matrix interactive visualization of dendrograms that superimposes the relationship between individual objects on to the hierarchy of clusters. Dendrogramix enables users to do tasks which involve both clusters and individual objects that are impracticable with the classical representation, like: to explain why a particular objects belongs to a particular cluster; to elicit and understand uncommon patterns (e.g., objects that could have been classified in a totally different cluster); etc. Those sensemaking tasks are supported by a consistent set of interaction techniques that facilitates the exploration of large clustering results."
466,The DeepTree Exhibit: Visualizing the Tree of Life to Facilitate Informal Learning,"In this paper, we present the DeepTree exhibit, a multi-user, multi-touch interactive visualization of the Tree of Life. We developed DeepTree to facilitate collaborative learning of evolutionary concepts. We will describe an iterative process in which a team of computer scientists, learning scientists, biologists, and museum curators worked together throughout design, development, and evaluation. We present the importance of designing the interactions and the visualization hand-in-hand in order to facilitate active learning. The outcome of this process is a fractal-based tree layout that reduces visual complexity while being able to capture all life on earth; a custom rendering and navigation engine that prioritizes visual appeal and smooth fly-through; and a multi-user interface that encourages collaborative exploration while offering guided discovery. We present an evaluation showing that the large dataset encouraged free exploration, triggers emotional responses, and facilitates visitor engagement and informal learning."
467,Technical appendix: The DeepTree layout and rendering engine,This technical report provides details regarding the DeepTree layout and rendering engine
468,Aesthetic layout of generalized trees,"Research on the aesthetic layout of trees has been largely concerned with the special case of binary trees with small constant-sized nodes. Yet, without otherwise requiring the power of general graph-layout algorithms, many layout problems involve n-ary trees with variable-sized nodes. This paper addresses the general issue of the aesthetic layout of such trees. Two algorithms are presented for the layout of generalized trees, and general issues, such as appropriate aesthetics, are discussed. The algorithms described are suitable for such tasks as the layout of class hierarchies, directory trees and tableau-style proofs."
469,Bubble Trees -- The visualization of hierarchical information structures,"A tree visualization mechanism is proposed, based on the natural property of trees to recursively sub-categorize themselves into sub-trees. Each sub-tree is graphically represented as a bubble, which aggregates detail by enclosing lower-level information. Navigation and information retrieval are facilitated through an elegant set of browsing interactions. The interface is useful for tasks where users are required to develop a mental model of a classification system. The interactive nature of bubble trees allows users to explore and work out relationships for themselves."

471,DEXiTree: A program for pretty drawing of trees,"This paper presents DEXiTree, a computer program for drawing trees. In principle, DEXiTree is aimed at making nice drawings of attribute trees made by DEXi, a computer program for qualitative multi-attribute decision modelling. Apart from that, DEXiTree is quite a general and powerful tree-drawing program that implements four different tree-drawing algorithms (called Distribute, Align, Walker, and QP), draws trees in four different directions (top-down, left-right, bottom-up and right-left) and provides an extensive set of parameters for controlling the appearance of trees and their components. DEXiTree’s functionality includes loading a decision model from a DEXi file, interactively designing the tree layout, saving and loading the layout using an XML format, and rendering the drawing in two graphic formats: vector and raster."
472,Generative Design,"Generative design is a revolutionary new method of creating artwork, models, and animations from sets of rules, or algorithms. By using accessible programming languages such as Processing, artists and designers are producing extravagant, crystalline structures that can form the basis of anything from patterned textiles and typography to lighting, scientific diagrams, sculptures, films, and even fantastical buildings. Opening with a gallery of thirty-five illustrated case studies, Generative Design takes users through specific, practical instructions on how to create their own visual experiments by combining simple-to-use programming codes with basic design principles. A detailed handbook of advanced strategies provides visual artists with all the tools to achieve proficiency. Both a how-to manual and a showcase for recent work in this exciting new field, Generative Design is the definitive study and reference book that designers have been waiting for."
473,DensiTree: Making sense of sets of phylogenetic trees,"Bayesian analysis through programs like BEAST (Drummond and Rumbaut, 2007) and MrBayes (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001) provides a powerful method for reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. One of the benefits of Bayesian methods is that well-founded estimates of uncertainty in models can be made available. So, for example, not only the mean time of a most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) is estimated, but also the spread. This distribution over model space is represented by a set of trees, which can be rather large and difficult to interpret. DensiTree is a tool that helps navigating these sets of trees. The main idea behind DensiTree is to draw all trees in the set transparently. As a result, areas where a lot of the trees agree in topology and branch lengths show up as highly colored areas, while areas with little agreement show up as webs. This makes it possible to quickly get an impression of properties of the tree set such as well-supported clades, distribution of tMRCA and areas of topological uncertainty. Thus, DensiTree provides a quick method for qualitative analysis of tree sets."
474,DensiTree 2: Seeing trees through the forest,"Phylogenetic analysis like Bayesian MCMC or bootstrapping result in a collection of trees. Trees are discrete objects and it is generally difficult to get a mental grip on a distributions over trees. Visualisation tools like DensiTree can give good intuition on tree distributions. It works by drawing all trees in the set transparently thus highlighting areas where the tree in the set agrees. In this way, both uncertainty in clade heights and uncertainty in topology can be visualised. In our experience, a vanilla DensiTree can turn out to be misleading in that it shows too much uncertainty due to wrongly ordering taxa or due to unlucky placement of internal nodes. DensiTree is extended to allow visualisation of meta-data associated with branches such as population size and evolutionary rates. Furthermore, geographic locations of taxa can be shown on a map, making it easy to visually check there is some geographic pattern in a phylogeny. Taxa orderings have a large impact on the layout of the tree set, and advances have been made in finding better orderings resulting in significantly more informative visualisations. We also explored various methods for positioning internal nodes, which can improve the quality of the image. Together, these advances make it easier to comprehend distributions over trees."
475,Multilevel Compound Tree -- Construction Visualization and Interaction,"Several hierarchical clustering techniques have been proposed to visualize large graphs, but fewer solutions suggest a focus based approach. We propose a multilevel clustering technique that produces in linear time a contextual clustered view depending on a user-focus. We get a tree of clusters where each cluster - called meta-silhouette - is itself hierarchically clustered into an inclusion tree of silhouettes. Resulting Multilevel Silhouette Tree (MuSi-Tree) has a specific structure called multilevel compound tree. This work builds upon previous work on a compound tree structure called MO-Tree. The work presented in this paper is a major improvement over previous work by (1) defining multilevel compound tree as a more generic structure, (2) proposing original space-filling visualization techniques to display it, (3) defining relevant interaction model based on both focus changes and graph filtering techniques and (4) reporting from case studies in various fields: co-citation graphs, related-document graphs and social graphs."
476,Method and apparatus for visualization of database search results,"A method and apparatus for representing the results of a search of a database. The present invention provides for creating a view of database search results via a tree structure in which detail is selected and context preserved. In the present invention, the tree structure is created based on user specified parameters. These parameters represent attributes of documents stored in the database and may differ from the search parameters. The tree structure is then mapped to a static reference surface which is visually perceived as three-dimensional. The reference surface is comprised of a detail area where detail of the tree structure is displayed and a context area for displaying other portions of the tree in less detail but which conveys to the viewer a sense of context. The tree structure may be scrolled about the reference surface to bring portions of the structure into a direct detail view while retaining a context view of the overall tree."
477,Sphere-based Information Visualization: Challenges and Benefits,Use of a sphere as a basis for organizing an information visualization should balance issues such as occlusion against potential useful benefits such as natural navigational affordances and perceptual connotations of an application.
478,Graphic Presentation,"Graphic Presentation is largely a collection of interesting charts and pictures, mostly of a non-technical nature,covering a wide range of subject matter, with brief comment on methodology under each illustration. These charts and pictures are reproductions from numerous sources, including a few from his Graphic Methods. In addition to the chapters on types of charts and excerpts from Time Series Charts: A Manual of Design and Construction published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, there are some quasi-technical chapters on such things as the use of cameras and lantern slides, selection of paper, and methods of reproduction, printing, and binding. A chapter on tabulation is thrown in, apparently for good measure. Illustrations on alternate pairs of facing pages arc in color, and these pages contain also decorative chapter identification (bleed-outs) at the top and bottom. Printing was done by the photo offset process. The verbal language is Basic English. A minor feature of the book is a device whereby the reader may spin the pages rapidly until he reaches the desired chapter. On page 453 is given a detailed description of how the book was made up, including the names and addresses of the companies furnishing materials or services. This book departs from the earlier contribution in several respects. Text material is boiled down almost to the vanishing point, leaving the maximum number of charts to speak for themselves."
479,Visualization of Large-Scale Customer Satisfaction Surveys Using a Parallel Coordinate Tree,"Satisfaction surveys are an important measurement tool in fields such as market research or human resources management. Serious studies consist of numerous questions and contain answers from large population samples. Aggregation on both sides, the questions asked as well as the answers received, turns the multidimensional problem into a complex system of interleaved hierarchies. Traditional ways of presenting the results are limited to one-dimensional charts and cross-tables. We developed a visualization method called the Parallel Coordinate Tree that combines multidimensional analysis with a tree structure representation. Distortion-oriented focus+context techniques are used to facilitate interaction with the visualization. In this paper we present a design study of a commercial application that we built, using this method to analyze and communicate results from large-scale customer satisfaction surveys."
480,Drawing trees nicely with TeX,"Various algorithms have been proposed for the difficult problem of producing aesthetically pleasing drawings of trees, see Reingold and Tilford (1981), Wetherell and Shannon (1979) but implementations only exist as ``special purpose software'', designed for special environments. Therefore, many users resort to the drawing facilites available on most personal computers, but the figures obtained in this way still look ``hand-drawn''; their quality is inferior to the quality of the surrounding text that can be realized by today''s high quality text processing systems. In this paper we present an entirely new solution that integrates a tree drawing algorithm into one of the best text processing systems available. More precisely, we present a TeX macro package TreeTeX that produces a drawing of a tree from a purely logical description. Our approach has three advantages. First, labels for nodes can be handled in a reasonable way. On the one hand, the tree drawing algorithm can compute the widths of the labels and take them into account for the positioning of the nodes; on the other hand, all the textual parts of the document can be treated uniformly. Second, TreeTeX can be trivially ported to any site running TeX. Finally, modularity in the description of a tree and TeX's macro capabilities allow for libraries of subtrees and tree classes. In addition, we have implemented an option that produces drawing which make the structure of the trees more obvious to the human eye, even though they may not be as aesthetically pleasing."
481,Squarified Treemaps,"An extension to the treemap method for the visualization of hierarchical information, such as directory structures and organization structures, is presented. The standard treemap method often gives thin, elongated rectangles. As a result, rectangles are difficult to compare and to select. A new method is presented to generate lay-outs in which the rectangles approximate squares. To strenghten the visualization of the structure, shaded frames are used around groups of related nodes."
482,Drawing ordered $(k-1)$-ary trees on $k$-grids,"We explore the complexity of drawing ordered $(k-1)$-ary trees on grids with k directions for $kin4,6,8$ and within a given area. This includes, e.g., ternary trees drawn on the orthogonal grid. For aesthetically pleasing tree drawings on these grids, we additionally present various restrictions similar to the common hierarchical case. First, we generalize the NP-hardness of minimal width in hierarchical drawings of ordered trees to $(k-1)$-ary trees on k-grids and then we generalize the Reingold and Tilford algorithm to k-grids."
483,Improving Walker's Algorithm to Run in Linear Time,"The algorithm of Walker is widely used for drawing trees of unbounded degree, and it is widely assumed to run in linear time, as the author claims in his article. But the presented algorithm clearly needs quadraticrun time. We explain the reasons for that and present a revised algorithm that creates the same layouts in linear time."
484,Adjacency-Preserving Spatial Treemaps,"Rectangular layouts, subdivisions of an outer rectangle into smaller rectangles, have many applications in visualizing spatial information, for instance in rectangular cartograms in which the rectangles represent geographic or political regions. A spatial treemap is a rectangular layout with a hierarchical structure: the outer rectangle is subdivided into rectangles that are in turn subdivided into smaller rectangles. We describe algorithms for transforming a rectangular layout that does not have this hierarchical structure, together with a clustering of the rectangles of the layout, into a spatial treemap that respects the clustering and also respects to the extent possible the adjacencies of the input layout."

486,Angle-Restricted Steiner Arborescences for Flow Map Layout,"Flow maps visualize the movement of objects between places. One or more sources are connected to several targets by arcs whose thickness corresponds to the amount of flow between a source and a target. Flow maps reduce visual clutter by merging (bundling) lines smoothly and by avoiding self-intersections. We present algorithms that compute crossing-free flows of high visual quality. To this end we introduce a new variant of the geometric Steiner arborescence problem. The goal is to connect the targets to a source with a tree of minimal length whose arcs obey a certain restriction on the angle they form with the source. Such an angle-restricted Steiner arborescence, or simply flow tree, naturally induces a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundles arcs. We study the properties of optimal flow trees and show that they consist of logarithmic spirals and straight lines. Computing optimal flow trees is NP-hard. Hence we consider a variant of flow trees which uses only logarithmic spirals, so called spiral trees. Spiral trees approximate flow trees within a factor depending on the angle restriction. Computing optimal spiral trees remains NP-hard. We present an efficient 2-approximation for spiral trees, which can be extended to avoid certain types of obstacles."
487,Flow Map Layout via Spiral Trees,"Flow maps are thematic maps that visualize the movement of objects, such as people or goods, between geographic regions. One or more sources are connected to several targets by lines whose thickness corresponds to the amount of flow between a source and a target. Good flow maps reduce visual clutter by merging (bundling) lines smoothly and by avoiding self-intersections. Most flow maps are still drawn by hand and only few automated methods exist. Some of the known algorithms do not support edge-bundling and those that do, cannot guarantee crossing-free flows. We present a new algorithmic method that uses edge-bundling and computes crossing-free flows of high visual quality. Our method is based on so-called spiral trees, a novel type of Steiner tree which uses logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees naturally induce a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundle lines. Our flows can also avoid obstacles, such as map features, region outlines, or even the targets. We validate our approach with extensive experiments."
488,Angle-Restricted Steiner Arborescences for Flow Map Layout,"We introduce a new variant of the geometric Steiner arborescence problem, motivated by the layout of flow maps. Flow maps show the movement of objects between places. They reduce visual clutter by bundling lines smoothly and avoiding self-intersections. To capture these properties, our angle-restricted Steiner arborescences, or flux trees, connect several targets to a source with a tree of minimal length whose arcs obey a certain restriction on the angle they form with the source. We study the properties of optimal flux trees and show that they are planar and consist of logarithmic spirals and straight lines. Flux trees have the shallow-light property. We show that computing optimal flux trees is NP-hard. Hence we consider a variant of flux trees which uses only logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees approximate flux trees within a factor depending on the angle restriction. Computing optimal spiral trees remains NP-hard, but we present an efficient 2-approximation, which can be extended to avoid ``positive monotone'' obstacles."
489,Navigation in degree of interest trees,"We present an experiment that compares how people perform search tasks in a degree-of-interest browser and in a Windows-Explorer-like browser. Our results show that, whereas users do attend to more information in the DOI browser, they do not complete the task faster than in an Explorer-like browser. However, in both types of browser, users are faster to complete high information scent search tasks than low information scent tasks. We present an ACT-R computational model of the search task in the DOI browser. The model describes how a visual search strategy may combine with semantic aspects of processing, as captured by information scent. We also describe a way of automatically estimating information scent in an ontological hierarchy by querying a large corpus (in our case, Google's corpus)."
490,Modeling Navigation in Degree-of-Interest Trees,"We present an ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998) computational model of how people navigate in a degree-of-interest (DOI) tree. The model incorporates a visual salience function that determines which part of the display to attend to next. The salience function uses visual features of the display (e.g., distances) and semantic features of labels (e.g., information scent). The model was compared against data from participants and provided medium to strong fits to latencies and the number of nodes visited by the participants. The model shows that it is useful to distinguish between category-based versus similarity-based information scent. It also suggests that visual distance and scent may interact with one another, with scent playing a greater role at distances close to the current node in the visual focus."
491,Timeline Trees: visualizing sequences of transactions in information hierarchies,"In many applications transactions between the elements of an information hierarchy occur over time. For example, the product offers of a department store can be organized into product groups and subgroups to form an information hierarchy. A market basket consisting of the products bought by a customer forms a transaction. Market baskets of one or more customers can be ordered by time into a sequence of transactions. Each item in a transaction is associated with a measure, for example, the amount paid for a product. In this paper we present a novel method for visualizing sequences of these kinds of transactions in information hierarchies. It uses a tree layout to draw the hierarchy and a timeline to represent progression of transactions in the hierarchy. We have developed several interaction techniques that allow the users to explore the data. Smooth animations help them to track the transitions between views. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by examples from several very different application domains."
492,Indented Pixel Tree Plots,"We introduce Indented Pixel Tree Plots (IPTPs): a novel pixel-based visualization technique for depicting large hierarchies. It is inspired by the visual metaphor of indented outlines, omnipresent in graphical file browsers and pretty printing of source code. Inner vertices are represented as vertically arranged lines and leaf groups as horizontally arranged lines. A recursive layout algorithm places parent nodes to the left side of their underlying tree structure and leaves of each subtree grouped to the rightmost position. Edges are represented only implicitly by the vertically and horizontally aligned structure of the plot, leading to a sparse and redundant-free visual representation. We conducted a user study with 30 subjects in that we compared IPTPs and node-link diagrams as a within-subjects variable. The study indicates that working with IPTPs can be learned in less than 10 minutes. Moreover, IPTPs are as effective as node-link diagrams for accuracy and completion time for three typical tasks; participants generally preferred IPTPs. We demonstrate the usefulness of IPTPs by understanding hierarchical features of huge trees such as the NCBI taxonomy with more than 300,000 nodes."
493,Visualizing Dynamic Quantitative Data in Hierarchies. TimeEdgeTrees: Attaching Dynamic Weights to Tree Edges,"In this paper we introduce a technique for visualizing the dynamics of quantitative data in static hierarchical structures. We exploit the straight links of orthogonal tree diagrams as a timeline on which we visually encode dynamic quantitative information. We use color coding and varying thicknesses to represent the time-varying data. Bimodal data can also be displayed by exploiting both sides of the time axes simultaneously. Our TimeEdgeTrees tool allows us to explore dynamic quantitative data in tree diagrams by interactive data filtering and zooming. The spatial proximity of neighboring hierarchically structured elements allows us to easily explore trends, countertrends, periodicity, temporal shifts, or anomalies during the evolution synchronously. Interactive features such as expanding or collapsing of subhierarchies additionally help to detect the aforementioned phenomena on different levels of granularity. The usefulness of our visualization technique is illustrated by water level data acquired at more than 450 measurement stations along German rivers for 768 points in time."
494,Indented Pixel Tree Browser for Exploring Huge Hierarchies,"In this paper we introduce the Indented Pixel Tree Browser -- an interactive tool for exploring, annotating, and comparing huge hierarchical structures on different levels of granularity. We exploit the indented visual metaphor to map tree structures to one-dimensional zigzag curves to primarily achieve an overview representation for the entire hierarchy. We focus on space-efficiency and simultaneous uncovering of tree-specific phenomena. Each displayed plot can be filtered for substructures that are mapped to a larger space and hence, unhide more fine-granular substructures that are hidden in the compressed overview. By representing tree structures side-by-side, the viewer can easily compare them visually and detect similar patterns and also anomalies. In our approach, we follow the information seeking mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand. More interactive features such as expanding and collapsing of nodes, applying different color codings, or distorting the tree horizontally as well as vertically support a viewer when exploring huge hierarchical data sets. The usefulness of our interactive browsing tool is demonstrated in a case study for the NCBI taxonomy that contains 324,276 species and organisms that are hierarchically organized."
495,"Enriching Indented Pixel Tree Plots with Node-Oriented Quantitative, Categorical, Relational, and Time-Series Data","Indented Pixel Tree Plots are useful for an overview of large and deep hierarchical data. As a major benefit, these plots scale to pixel or even subpixel resolution, still clearly visualizing the hierarchical structures and substructures in a redundant-free representation. Consequently, there is display space available that may be used to show additional information such as enlarged or filtered subregions, details-on-demand, or control panels. In this paper, we demonstrate how this compact indented diagram can be enriched with additional data associated with both leaf and inner nodes of the hierarchy. To this end, we support quantitative, categorical, relational, and time-series data. By such a combination, exploration and analysis of visual patterns and anomalies on different levels of hierarchical granularity are possible in a static diagram. Furthermore, interactive features such as expanding/collapsing of subhierarchies, horizontal/vertical distortions, zooming in/out, or details-on-demand are integrated to allow the user to inspect the data from different viewpoints. The usefulness of the enriched diagrams is illustrated by applying them to file system data where single software constructs are hierarchically organized. Here, we focus on quantitative, categorical, and relational data attached to the nodes of the hierarchy. In a second case study, we demonstrate how evolving water level data of rivers in Germany can be represented by our plots."
496,Method and apparatus for improving the visibility of a Treemap,"The visibility of a treemap is improved by offsetting the area of a parent node relative to a bounding box containing all of its child nodes while constructing the treemap, so that a part of the bounding box lies outside the area of the parent node, and the area of each child node in the bounding box is located entirely or partially within the area of the parent node. The present invention highlights the parent-child relationships in the treemap with a cascading effect to make the structural information therein more apparent and easier to recognize."
497,Method and apparatus for generating 3D Carousel Tree data visualization and related device,"A method for generating 3D carousel visualization of large-scale tree data, which comprises the steps of: receiving a user's selection of a node in the carousel; according to the radius of a sub-carousel corresponding to the user-selected node and the radius of a carousel at which the selected node is located, judging whether or not the sub-carousel can be expanded at the carousel at which the selected node is located; expanding the sub-carousel at the carousel at which the selected node is located, if it is determined that the sub-carousel can be expanded at the carousel at which the selected node is located. A device capable of implementing the method is provided. The number of carousel levels visualized on a visualization device can be adjusted dynamically, and the visualization of a focus becomes more prominent, and relationships between nodes at each level of the tree data visualization get more apparent."
498,Degree-of-interest trees: a component of an attention-reactive user interface,"This paper proposes Degree-of-Interest trees. These trees use degree-of-interest calculations and focus+context visualization methods, together with bounding constraints, to fit within pre-established bounds. The method is an instance of an emerging ""attention-reactive"" user interface whose components are designed to snap together in bounded spaces."
499,System and method for browsing hierarchically based node-link structures based on an estimated degree of interest,"Method and system to enable a user to view large collections of hierarchically linked information on a computer based display. A tree structure visualization is created which presents a representation of the complete collection of information on the display. The visualization fits completely within a fixed area of the computer based display, negating the need to scroll information into the display area. The visualization is based on identified focus nodes and through calculation of a Degree of Interest (DOI) for each of the nodes based in the structure. Layout and presentation of the visualization structure is based on the DOI values in combination with considerations of available display space. A user may dynamically manipulate views of the structure by selecting one or more focus nodes, thus causing a recalculation of the degree of interest."
500,TimeTree: Exploring Time Changing Hierarchies,"Intelligence analysis often involves the task of gathering information about an organization. Knowledge about individuals in an organization and their relationships, often represented as a hierarchical organization chart, is crucial for understanding the organization. However, it is difficult for intelligence analysts to follow all individuals in an organization. Existing hierarchy visualizations have largely focused on the visualization of fixed structures and can not effectively depict the evolution of a hierarchy over time. We introduce TimeTree, a novel visualization tool designed to enable exploration of a changing hierarchy. TimeTree enables analysts to navigate the history of an organization, identify events associated with a specific entity (visualized on a TimeSlider), and explore an aggregate view of an individual's career path (a CareerTree). We demonstrate the utility of TimeTree by investigating a set of scenarios developed by an expert intelligence analyst. The scenarios are evaluated using a real dataset composed of eighteen thousand career events from more than eight thousand individuals. Insights gained from this analysis are presented."
501,Trees with convex faces and optimal angles,"We consider drawings of trees in which all edges incident to leaves can be extended to infinite rays without crossing, partitioning the plane into infinite convex polygons. Among all such drawings we seek the one maximizing the angular resolution of the drawing. We find linear time algorithms for solving this problem, both for plane trees and for trees without a fixed embedding. In any such drawing, the edge lengths may be set independently of the angles, without crossing; we describe multiple strategies for setting these lengths."
502,PhylloTrees: Harnessing Nature's Phyllotactic Patterns for Tree Layout,"We explore the use of nature’s phyllotactic patterns to inform the layout of hierarchical data. These naturally occurring patterns provide a non-overlapping, optimal packing when the total number of nodes is not known a priori. We present a family of expandable tree layouts based on these patterns."
503,Research report. Interacting with huge hierarchies: Beyond Cone Trees,"The paper describes an implementation of a tool for visualizing and interacting with huge information hierarchies, and some preliminary empirical evaluation of the tool's efficacy. Existing systems for visualizing huge hierarchies using cone trees ""break down"" once the hierarchy to be displayed exceeds roughly 1000 nodes, due to increasing visual clutter. The paper describes a system called fsviz which visualizes arbitrarily large hierarchies while retaining user control. This is accomplished by augmenting cone trees with several graphical and interaction techniques: usage-based filtering, animated zooming, hand-coupled rotation, fish-eye zooming, coalescing of distant nodes, texturing, effective use of colour for depth cueing, and the applications of dynamic queries. The fsviz system also improves upon earlier cone tree visualization systems through a more elaborate node layout algorithm. This algorithm enhances the usefulness of cone tree visualization for large hierarchies by all but eliminating clutter."
504,The Bifocal Tree: A Technique for the Visualization of Hierarchical Information Structures,"This paper reports a new technique for visualizing hierarchies which is based on the focus+context concept, but uses two foci instead of one. The technique allows improving the presentation of details related to some item in the information space as well as the context. This is achieved by displaying the hierarchy as a node-edge diagram separated in two connected sub-diagrams. One corresponds to the subtree with the node of interest as root. The other one represents the context and contains the selected node parent and remaining subtrees. Interaction issues regarding browsing and other operations are also discussed."
505,A heuristic extending the Squarified treemapping algorithm,"A heuristic extending the Squarified Treemap technique for the representation of hierarchical information as treemaps is presented. The original technique gives high quality treemap views, since items are laid out with rectangles that approximate squares, allowing easy comparison and selection operations. New key steps, with a low computational impact, have been introduced to yield treemaps with even better aspect ratios and higher homogeneity among items."
506,A Self-adaptive Treemap-based Technique for Visualizing Hierarchical Data in 3D,"In this paper, we present a novel adaptive visualization technique where the constituting polygons dynamically change their geometry and other visual attributes depending on user interaction. These changes take place with the objective of conveying required level of detail to the user through each view. Our proposed technique is successfully applied to build a treemap-based but 3D visualization of hierarchical data, a widely used information structure. This new visualization exploits its adaptive nature to address issues like cluttered display, imperceptible hierarchy, lack of smooth zoom-in and out technique which are common in tree visualization. We also present an algorithm which utilizes the flexibility of our proposed technique to deal with occlusion, a problem inherent in any 3D information visualization. On one hand, our work establishes adaptive visualization as a means of displaying tree-structured data in 3D. On the other, it promotes the technique as a potential candidate for being employed to visualize other information structures also."
507,Analysis and extension of tree visualization,"Information visualization has always attracted human eye, as visual representation and interaction techniques allows one's mind to explore and understand large amount of information at a glance. Various information visualization techniques have been developed to show results in novel forms like graph drawing, hyperbolic tree, tree mapping and many more. Some recent development in visualization techniques has been done using fractal grammar and adoption for some existing aesthetic forms. This thesis presents how the existing algorithm of tree-mapping can be made more interactive and informative for end users. By adding level based information display, displaying communities in tree and treemap and animating the tree drawing adds more readability and reduces ambiguity of treemap. We will also discuss, what are various ways for data to be extracted and how new information can be derived from a given data set."
508,A Magic Treemap Cube for Visualizing Olympic Games Data,"Treemap, a common information visualization approach for dividing a display area into nested rectangles, has a good performance on visualizing hierarchical data. And it enables user to compare nodes in the same level and to learn certain relationship between adjacent levels. However, treemap layout is limited to visualize multi-dimensional hierarchical data in which the hierarchy is unfixed and complex, especially when the hierarchy is an arbitrary graph. Considering this problem, we present a novel extension called magic treemap cube, which improves the layout and has a good performance on visualizing unfixed (cross-level) and complex data, inverting hierarchy without reorganizing the structure, and enabling users to easily compare among treemaps. The magic treemap cube is a three-dimensional regular hexahedron whose six faces are covered by six different treemaps. Each dimension of the magic treemap cube is a hierarchy structure specified by users according to a hierarchical division of visualization information. With the treemap algorithm, tagcloud and mapping rules, the treemaps are automatically controlled by permutations of three dimensions of the cube. Users could observe the six correlative treemaps respectively by rotating the magic treemap cube in three dimensional Cartesian coordinate. And this magic treemap cube can be unfolded into a tiled treemap in 2D Cartesian coordinate for users-friendly comparison of each treemap. Meanwhile, a merging operation to the tiled treemap is proposed to not only compare two treemaps through the adjacency relations among faces but also provide more information. For demonstrating the above characteristics, an application (called OlympicVis) has been implemented to visualize the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games information, which involves multi-dimensional hierarchy and interconnected data. The OlympicVis can display Cube View, Schedule View, Medal View, Date Filter and Time Line."
509,Sunburst with ordered nodes based on hierarchical clustering: A visual analyzing method for associated hierarchical pesticide residue data,"According to the characteristics of pesticide residue data and analyzing requirements in food safety fields, we presented a visual analyzing method for associated hierarchical data, called sunburst with ordered nodes based on hierarchical clustering (SONHC). SONHC arranged the leaf nodes in sunburst in order using hierarchical clustering algorithm, put the associated dataset as a node in center of the sunburst, and connected it with the associated leaf nodes in sunburst using colored lines. So, it can present not only two hierarchical structures but also the relationships between them. Based on SONHC and some interaction techniques (clicking, contraction and expansion, etc) we developed an associated visual analyzing system (AVAS) for pesticide residues detection results data, which can help users to inspect the hierarchical structure of pesticide and agricultural products and to explore the associations between pesticides and agricultural products, and associations between different pesticides. The results of user experience test showed that SONHC algorithm overperforms than SA and SR algorithm in ULE and ULE’s variance. AVAS system is effective in helping users to analyze the pesticide residues data. Furthermore, SONHC algorithm can also be adopted to analyze associated hierarchical data in other fields, such as finance, insurance and e-commerce."
510,Structural Analysis and Visualization of C++ Code Evolution using Syntax Trees,"We present a method to detect and visualize evolution patterns in C++ source code. Our method consists of three steps. First, we extract an annotated syntax tree (AST) from each version of a given C++ source code. Next, we hash the extracted syntax nodes based on a metric combining structure and type information, and construct matches (correspondences) between similar-hash subtrees. Our technique detects code fragments which have not changed, or changed little, during the software evolution. By parameterizing the similarity metric, we can flexibly decide what is considered to be identical or not during the software evolution. Finally, we visualize the evolution of the code structure by emphasizing both changing and constant code patterns. We demonstrate our technique on a versioned code base containing a variety of changes ranging from simple to complex."
511,Modified RELT for Display and Navigation of Large Hierarchy on Handheld Touch-Screen Devices,"Visualizing and exploring a hierarchical structure on a smartphone screen is challenging. On larger screens of PCs and laptops these types of structures are often shown in a tabular view. Due to the width restriction, tabular view is not feasible on smaller screens. This paper presents a visualization technique that displays multiple levels of a hierarchical structure on a single view for small screens and allows users to explore the structure rapidly through touch input. The visualization technique makes full use of the available space and distributes the space fairly among nodes. The system allows selection and display of relevant information based on user query or user habit, while hiding less important items from the view."
512,ERELT: a faster alternative to the list-based interfaces for tree exploration and searching in mobile devices,"This paper presents ERELT (Enhanced Radial Edgeless Tree), a tree visualization approach on modern mobile devices. ERELT is designed to offer a clear visualization of any tree structure with intuitive interaction. We are interested in both the observation and navigation of such structures. Such visualization can assist users in interacting with a hierarchical structure such as a media collection, file system, etc. In the ERELT visualization, a subset of the tree is displayed at a time. The displayed tree size depends on the maximum number of tree elements that can be put on the screen while maintaining clarity. Users can quickly navigate to the hidden parts of the tree through touch-based gestures. We conducted a user study to evaluate this visualization for a music collection. Test results show that this approach reduces the time and effort in navigating tree structures for exploration and search tasks."

Users can quickly navigate to the hidden parts of the tree through touch-based gestures. We have conducted a user study to evaluate this visualization for a music collection. The study results show that this approach reduces the time and effort in navigating tree structures for exploration and search tasks."
514,Extending the utility of treemaps with flexible hierarchy,"Treemaps are a visualization technique for presenting hierarchical information on two-dimensional displays. Prior implementations limit the visualization to pre-defined static hierarchies. Flexible hierarchy, a new capability of Treemap 4.0, enables users to define various hierarchies through dynamically selecting a series of data attributes so that they can discover patterns, clusters and outliers. This work describes the design and implementation issues of flexible hierarchy. It then reports on a usability study, which led to enhancements to the interface."
515,Strata Treemaps,"Treemap is a method of visualization to recognize a hierarchical structure of data using the size and arrangement of nested rectangles. A limitation of a treemap is the difficulty to discern the structure of a hierarchy. Several approaches have been proposed to improve the visibility of the hierarchical structure. These approaches involve the use of a border or padding to emphasize the hierarchical structure. However, this leads to a disparity between the node weight and the relative node size."
516,Dynamic Aggregation with Circular Visual Designs,"One very effective method for managing large data sets is aggregation or binning. We consider two aggregation methods that are tightly coupled with interactive manipulation and the visual representation of the data. Through this integration we hope to provide effective support for the aggregation process, specifically by enabling: 1) automatic aggregation, 2) continuous change and control of the aggregation level, 3) spatially based aggregates, 4) context maintenance across different aggregate levels, and 5) feedback on the level of aggregation."
517,Visualization of Syntax Tree Based on VML,"In the Chinese teaching and research, it often needs to draw syntax tree for the analyzing of relationship among compositions of sentence. Drawn syntax tree manually has many defects, such as having huge workload, needing immense storage capacity and so on. So it is of importance to do research of automatically generating syntax tree and its visualization. In this paper, it proposes a method to generate syntax tree automatically and display the syntax tree in web page by using VML technology. By comparing the syntax trees generated in this paper with the syntax trees got from Treebank of PKU, the result shows that the method of coordinate computing proposed in this paper is more precision, which also demonstrates the efficiency of the visualization method."
518,Virtual Worlds for Software Visualisation,"Understanding, quickly, completely and correctly, is crucial to every phase of the software development process. As system size and complexity continues to grow, effective visualisation of system components, together with their properties and relationships, becomes increasingly important in achieving understanding. Virtual worlds allow more information to be presented in visualisations while minimising the impact of cognitive information overload. In this paper, we describe our application of virtual worlds to visualisation of software engineering artifacts and present some examples from our work on object oriented software systems."
519,CHIVE -- A program source visualisation framework,"The CHIVE visualisation framework is an attempt to provide program comprehension and visualisation tool developers with a flexible means for creating 3-dimensional visualisations of hierarchies such as those that occur in program source. The CHIVE framework supports user definable datasets, multiple graph layouts and an environment in which users can interact with visualisations created from applying a graph layout to a dataset."
520,Methods and devices for mapping data files,"A method of mapping interconnections between a plurality of data files, such as files of the world wide web. The method comprises a step of, for a first file, in a display area displaying a first region. Then, according to a first distance scale, displaying one or more second regions, which respectively represent one or more second files logically related to the first file, for example by hyperlinks. The second regions are spatially related in a display to the first region. In (n-1) further steps, i=2,... , n, the method displays according to an i-th distance scale smaller than the (i-1)-th distance scale one or more (i+1)-th regions. Each of these (i+1)-th regions respectively represent one or more (i+1)-th files which are logically related to the i-th file, and they are spatially related on a display to the i-th region representing that i-th file. The method may be implemented in software, for example in a web browser."
521,Methods and devices for selecting items such as data files,"A method is described for allowing a user to select one of a plurality of items. The user employs a device having a display area, and a joystick or a contact sensitive area. The device displays a number of regions equal to the number of items, and defines a number of sections in the angular range of the joystick, or sections within the contact sensitive area, equal to the number of items, and arranged corresponding to the arrangement of the regions of the display area. The user selects one of said items by selecting the corresponding section."
522,An Evaluation of Cone Trees,"Cone Trees are an appealing interactive 3D visualization technique for hierarchical data structures. They were originally intended to maximise effective use of available screen space and to better exploit the abilities of the human perceptual system. Prior work has focused on the fidelity of the visualization rather than providing empirical user studies. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a low-fidelity animated and rapidly interactive 3D cone tree system. Results of the evaluation show that our subjects were slower at locating data using cone trees than when using a 'normal' tree browser, and that their performance deteriorated rapidly as the branching factor of the data-structure increased. Qualitative results, however, indicate that the subjects were enthusiastic about the cone tree visualization and that they felt it provided a better 'feel' for the structure of the information space."
523,DocuBurst: Visualizing Document Content using Language Structure,"Textual data is at the forefront of information management problems today. One response has been the development of visualizations of text data. These visualizations, commonly based on simple attributes such as relative word frequency, have become increasingly popular tools. We extend this direction, presenting the first visualization of document content which combines word frequency with the human-created structure in lexical databases to create a visualization that also reflects semantic content. DocuBurst is a radial, space-filling layout of hyponymy (the IS-A relation), overlaid with occurrence counts of words in a document of interest to provide visual summaries at varying levels of granularity. Interactive document analysis is supported with geometric and semantic zoom, selectable focus on individual words, and linked access to source text."
524,A note on optimal area algorithms for upward drawings of binary trees,"The goal of this paper is to investigate the area requirements for upward grid drawings of binary trees. First, we show that there is a family of binary trees with n vertices that require w(n*logn) area; this bound is tight to within a constant factor, i.e. any binary tree with n vertices can be drawn in O(n*logn) area. Then we present an algorithm for constructing an upward drawing of a complete binary tree with n vertices in O(n) area, and, finally, we extend this result to the drawings of Fibonacci trees."
525,Minimum-area h-v drawings of complete binary trees,"We study the area requirement of h-v drawings of complete binary trees. An h-v drawing of a binary tree t is a drawing of t such that (a) nodes are points with integer coordinates, (b) each edge is either a rightward-horizontal or a downward-vertical straight-line segment from a node to one of its children, (c) edges do not intersect, and (d) if t 1 and t 2 are immediate subtrees of a node u, the enclosing rectangles of the drawings of t 1 and t 2 are disjoint. We prove that, for any complete binary tree t of height h SQRT((n+1)/2)+3.5 if h is odd, (b) 2.5n–3.25SQRT(n+1)+3.5 otherwise. As far as we know, this is one of the few examples in which a closed formula for the minimum-area drawing of a graph has been explicitly found. Furthermore this minimum-area h-v drawing can be constructed in linear time. As a consequence of this result and the result of Trevisan (1996), we have that h-v drawings are provably less area-efficient than strictly upward drawings when we restrict ourselves to complete binary trees. We also give analogous results for the minimum-perimeter and the minimum-enclosing square area h-v drawings."
526,FundExplorer: Supporting the diversification of mutual fund portfolios using Context Treemaps,"An equity mutual fund is a financial instrument that invests in a set of stocks. Any two different funds may partially invest in some of the same stocks, thus overlap is common. Portfolio diversification aims at spreading an investment over many different stocks in search of greater returns. Helping people with portfolio diversification is challenging because it requires informing them about both their current portfolio of stocks held through funds and the other stocks in the market not invested in yet. Current stock/fund visualization systems either waste screen real estate and visualization of all data points. We have developed a system called FundExplorer that implements a distorted treemap to visualize both the amount of money invested in a person's fund portfolio and the context of remaining market stocks. The FundExplorer system enables people to interactively explore diversification possibilities with their portfolios."
527,Point Placement by Phylogenetic Trees and its Application to Visual Analysis of Document Collections,"The task of building effective representations to visualize and explore collections with moderate to large number of documents is hard. It depends on the evaluation of some distance measure among texts and also on the representation of such relationships in bi- dimensional spaces. In this paper we introduce an alternative approach for building visual maps of documents based on their content similarity, through reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. The tree is capable of representing relationships that allows the user to quickly recover information detected by the similarity metric. For a variety of text collections of different natures we show that we can achieve improved exploration capability and more clear visualization of relationships amongst documents."
528,Double Tree: An Advanced KWIC Visualization for Expert Users,"In this paper we present Double Tree, a new visualization of Key Word In Context (KWIC) displays targeted to support linguistic analysis. Inspired by Wattenberg's and Viegas' Word Tree visualization, Double Tree extends the idea of representing KWIC results as trees. We address several issues with Word Trees with respect to the specific demands of linguists and discuss the design decisions and implementation details that we chose for Double Tree. In particular we present our approach for displaying a two-sided tree. We describe details of the layout, including how frequency and linguistic information is incorporated, and what user interaction is supported. We conclude with some consideration on possible next steps for Double Tree."
529,Collapsible Cylindrical Trees: A Fast Hierarchical Navigation Technique,"This paper proposes a new visualization and interaction technique for medium-sized trees, called Collapsible Cylindrical Trees (CCT). Child nodes are mapped on rotating cylinders, which will be dynamically displayed or hidden to achieve a useful balance of detail and context. Besides a comprehensible three-dimensional visualization of trees, the main feature of CCT is a very fast and intuitive interaction with the displayed nodes. Only a single click is needed to reach every node and perform an action on it, such as displaying a web page. The CCT browsing technique was developed for interaction with web hierarchies but is not limited to this domain. We also present sample implementations of CCT using VRML, which show the usefulness of this intuitive tree navigation technique."
530,CactusTree: A tree drawing approach for hierarchical edge bundling,"This paper introduces CactusTree, a novel visualization technique for representing hierarchical datasets. We introduce details about the construction of CactusTrees and describe how they can be used to represent nested data and relationships between elements in the data. We explain how our design decisions were informed by tasks common to a range of scientific domains. A key contribution of this article is the introduction of descriptive features that can be used to characterize trees in terms of their structural and connective qualities."
531,A User Study of Techniques for Visualizing Structure and Connectivity in Hierarchical Datasets,"Many tree layouts have been created for presenting hierarchical data. However, layouts optimized for some tasks are not adequate for others. In this paper, we focus on identifying tree structures and cross-links generated by hierarchical edge bundling. Our key contribution is the introduction of descriptive features that can be used to characterize trees in terms of their structural and connective qualities. We present a user study with 14 subjects that provides an evaluation of our approach in comparison to other popular tree visualization techniques. The results of the study indicate which techniques are more effective for visual analysis tasks that involve identifying and comparing tree and subtree structures and/or visualizing connections using hierarchical edge bundling."
532,Embedding Stacked Polytopes on a Polynomial-Size Grid,"We show how to realize a stacked 3D polytope (formed by repeatedly stacking a tetrahedron onto a triangular face) by a strictly convex embedding with its n vertices on an integer grid of size $O(n^4)times O(n^4)times O(n^18)$. We use a perturbation technique to construct an integral 2D embedding that lifts to a small 3D polytope, all in linear time. This result solves a question posed by G""unter M. Ziegler, and is the first nontrivial subexponential upper bound on the long-standing open question of the grid size necessary to embed arbitrary convex polyhedra, that is, about efficient versions of Steinitz's 1916 theorem. An immediate consequence of our result is that $O(log n)$-bit coordinates suffice for a greedy routing strategy in planar 3-trees."
533,Infinite trees and the future,"We study the problem of designing layout facilities for the navigation of an ""infinite"" graph, i.e. a graph that is so large that its visualization is unfeasible, even by gluing together all the screen snapshots that a user can take during the navigation. We propose a framework for designing layout facilities that support the navigation of an infinite tree. The framework allows to exploit the knowledge of future moves of the user in order to reduce the changes in her mental map during the navigation. Variants of the classical Reingold-Tilford algorithm are presented and their performance is studied both experimentally and analytically."
534,Finding and Understanding Reusable Designs from Large Hierarchical Repositories,"This paper describes a prototype called CoMem (Corporate Memory) that supports the finding and understanding of useful items in large hierarchical repositories. The particular domain is civil engineering design, and the prototype is designed specifically to support design reuse in building construction projects. However, the underlying visualization and interaction principals behind CoMem are generalizable to the ubiquitous task of finding and understanding useful information in large hierarchical repositories. To support the finding, the entire hierarchy is visualized using a squarified treemap. Once an item from the treemap is selected, CoMem supports the understanding of that item by identifying related items in the hierarchy and visualizing the selected item in the context of these related items in a node-link diagram. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of a usability evaluation of CoMem that supports the claim that finding and understanding improve the process of reuse, and that the described visualizations assist with finding and understanding."
535,Understanding the use of inheritance with visual patterns,"The goal of this work is to visualize inheritance in object-oriented programs to help its comprehension. We propose a single, compact view of all class hierarchies at once using a custom Sunburst layout. It enables to quickly discover interesting facts across classes while preserving the essential relationship between parent and children classes. We explain how standard inheritance metrics are mapped into our visualization. Additionally, we define a new metric characterizing similar children classes. Using these metrics and the proposed layout, a set of common visual patterns is derived. These patterns allow the programmer to quickly understand how inheritance is used and provide answers to some essential questions when performing program comprehension tasks. Our approach is evaluated through a case study that involves examples from large programs, demonstrating its scalability."
536,Lifemap: Exploring the entire Tree of Life,"The Tree of Life (ToL) is meant to be a unique representation of the evolutionary relationships between all species on earth. Huge efforts are made to assemble such a large tree, helped by the decrease of sequencing costs and improved methods to reconstruct and combine phylogenies, but no tool exists today to explore the ToL in its entirety in a satisfying manner. By combining methods used in modern cartography, such as OpenStreetMap, with a new way of representing tree-like structures, I created Lifemap, a tool allowing the exploration of a complete representation of the ToL (between 800,000 and 2.2 million species depending on the data source) in a zoomable interface. A server version of Lifemap also allows users to visualize their own trees. This should help researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology in their everyday work, but may also permit the diffusion to a broader audience of our current knowledge of the evolutionary relationships linking all organisms."
537,The botanical beauty of random binary trees,"We present a simple mechanism for quickly rendering computer images of botanical trees based on random binary trees commonly found in computer science. That is, we visualize abstract binary trees as botanical ones. We generate random binary trees by splitting based upon the beta distribution, and obtain the standard binary search trees as a special case. We draw them in PostScript to resemble actual botanical trees found in nature. Through flexible parameterization and extensive randomization, we can produce a rich collection of images."
538,Architectures to make simple visualisations using simple systems,"In previous work, the first author argued for simple lightweight visualisations. These are surprisingly complex to produce due to the need for infrastructure to read files, etc. onCue, a desktop 'agent', aids the rapid production of such visualisations and their integration with desktop and Internet applications. Two examples are used dancing histograms for 2D tables and pieTrees for hierarchical numeric data. A major focus is the importance of architecture, both that of onCue itself and the underlying component infrastructure on which it is built - separation of concerns, mixed initiative computation and plug-and-play components lead to easily produced and easily used systems."
539,Node-Link and Containment Methods in Ontology Visualization,"OWL Ontology language can be very expressive. This could provide difficulty in ontology understanding process. We belief, that an ontology visualization equipped with intuitive interactions can simplify this process, and help the user during ontology exploration and development. We introduce an approach representing an ontology with two different tree visualization techniques: the node-link technique, and the containment technique. These two representations show the structure of an ontology differently. The former, represents an ontology as a graph structure. This graph structure, based on the ontology hierarchy and properties, can be explored in different geometries: Euclidean, hyperbolic and spherical. The second representation shows only the hierarchical structure. The design of the containment approach is implemented in a non-standard way. In place of traditional two-dimensional space-filling techniques, we elaborate on the sphere-packing approach and make our hierarchy visualization three-dimensional. We augment this technique with the semantic zoom functionality, where the level of detail is a function of a distance from the viewer."
540,Interactive Fan Charts: A Space-Saving Technique for Genealogical Graph Exploration,"Fan charts are a popular method for displaying family trees in a compact way. We extend the concept of fan charts to include a number of interactive metaphors, thus transforming what was a static display medium into an interactive tool for browsing and editing genealogical data."
541,Nmap: A Novel Neighborhood Preservation Space-filling Algorithm,"Space-filling techniques seek to use as much as possible the visual space to represent a dataset, splitting it into regions that represent the data elements. Amongst those techniques, Treemaps have received wide attention due to its simplicity, reduced visual complexity, and compact use of the available space. Several different Treemap algorithms have been proposed, however the core idea is the same, to divide the visual space into rectangles with areas proportional to some data attribute or weight. Although pleasant layouts can be effectively produced by the existing techniques, most of them do not take into account relationships that might exist between different data elements when partitioning the visual space. This violates the distance-similarity metaphor, that is, close rectangles do not necessarily represent similar data elements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Neighborhood Treemap (Nmap), that seeks to solve this limitation by employing a slice and scale strategy where the visual space is successively bisected on the horizontal or vertical directions and the bisections are scaled until one rectangle is defined per data element. Compared to the current techniques with the same similarity preservation goal, our approach presents the best results while being two to three orders of magnitude faster. The usefulness of Nmap is shown by two applications involving the organization of document collections and the construction of cartograms illustrating its effectiveness on different scenarios."
542,To treat of the world -- Paul Otlet's ontology and epistemology and the circle of knowledge,"The purpose of this paper is to document how Paul Otlet, founding-father of what is termed at present as information science, attempted to provide a complete image of the world (and reality in general) by establishing the scientific discipline he dubbed documentation. The paper also aims to focus on how Otlet represented human knowledge and reality in a systematic and unified way. Most importantly, it is shown that Otlet's views on documentation were immersed in a cosmological, objectivist, humanitarian and ontological framework that is alien to contemporary information science. Correspondingly, his alleged affinity with positivism is reassessed."
543,Drawing Trees with Perfect Angular Resolution and Polynomial Area,"We study methods for drawing trees with perfect angular resolution, i.e., with angles at each vertex, v, equal to $2pi /d(v)$. We show: 1.Any unordered tree has a crossing-free straight-line drawing with perfect angular resolution and polynomial area. 2. There are ordered trees that require exponential area for any crossing-free straight-line drawing having perfect angular resolution. 3. Any ordered tree has a crossing-free Lombardi-style drawing (where each edge is represented by a circular arc) with perfect angular resolution and polynomial area. Thus, our results explore what is achievable with straight-line drawings and what more is achievable with Lombardi-style drawings, with respect to drawings of trees with perfect angular resolution."
544,Hi-Tree Layout Using Quadratic Programming,"Horizontal placement of nodes in tree layout or layered drawings of directed graphs can be modelled as a convex quadratic program. Thus, quadratic programming provides a declarative framework for specifying such layouts which can then be solved optimally with a standard quadratic programming solver. While slower than specialized algorithms, the quadratic programming approach is fast enough for practical applications and has the great benefit of being flexible yet easy to implement with standard mathematical software. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by using it to layout hi-trees. These are a tree-like structure with compound nodes recently introduced for visualizing the logical structure of arguments and of decisions."
545,Drawing free trees,"Trees are models of various structures in computing and it is not surprising that considerable efforts have been made towards effective drawing algorithms for them. This paper discusses drawing algorithms for ""free trees"", that is, trees with no special root. The aim of these algorithms is to provide a drawing which satisfies several aesthetic criteria, such as avoiding edge crossings, minimizing variance in edge length, and keeping vertices a resonable distance apart. In this paper we measure the effectiveness of the algorithm presented by proving or disproving that they achieve such criteria."
546,Minimum size h-v drawings,"Trees are one of the most commonly used structures in computing, and many techniques for the visualization of trees are available. These techniques usually aim to find an aestetically pleasing layout for a tree on a screen of limited size. This paper presents an algorithm for ""h-v tree"" drawing. The algorithm can be used to find a drawing of minimal ""size"", where ""size"" has a variety of definitions (inclusing area). Two applications of the algorithm are explicitly presented."
547,Two Tree Drawing Conventions,"Rooted trees abound in computing and it is often necessary to draw them for visualization and documentation purposes. In the classical convention for tree drawing, the tree is drawn in a ""level"" fashion, with nodes (represented by boxes) at depth k lying on a horizontal line at a distance of k units below the root. The parent-child relationships are represented by lines between the boxes. Several algorithms have been developed for constructing a compact layout of a tree in the classical convention. In this paper we investigate algorithms for drawing trees according to two new conventions. In the inclusion convention, nodes are represented by boxes, and the parent-child relationship is represented by inclusion of one box in another. The tip-over convention again represents nodes as boxes, and, like the classical convention, represents the parent-child relationship by lines between the boxes; however, we allow siblings to be arranged vertically rather than horizontally. For many of the cases which arise in visualization of trees (for example, binary trees with textual information at the leaves) we present polynomial time algorithms. However, the general problem of finding minimum size layouts for either of the new conventions is shown to be NP-hard."
548,Visualizing the evolution of Web ecologies,"Several visualizations have emerged which attempt to visualize all or part of the World Wide Web. Those visualizations, however, fail to present the dynamically changing ecology of users and documents on the Web. We present new techniques for Web Ecology and Evolution Visualization (WEEV). Disk Trees represent a discrete time slice of the Web ecology. A collection of Disk Trees forms a Time Tube, representing the evolution of the Web over longer periods of time. These visualizations are intended to aid authors and webmasters with the production and organization of content, assist Web surfers making sense of information, and help researchers understand the Web."
549,Family tree visualization,
550,BaobabView: Interactive construction and analysis of decision trees,"We present a system for the interactive construction and analysis of decision trees that enables domain experts to bring in domain specific knowledge. We identify different user tasks and corresponding requirements, and develop a system incorporating a tight integration of visualization, interaction and algorithmic support. Domain experts are supported in growing, pruning, optimizing and analysing decision trees. Furthermore, we present a scalable decision tree visualization optimized for exploration. We show the effectiveness of our approach by applying the methods to two use cases. The first case illustrates the advantages of interactive construction, the second case demonstrates the effectiveness of analysis of decision trees and exploration of the structure of the data."
551,Ordered and Unordered Treemap. Algorithms and Their Applications on Handheld Devices,"This thesis describes a way to visualize hierarchical structures on PDAs using Treemaps. A new ordered layout algorithm for treemaps, called Split Layout, is presented. Traditionally, treemap algorithms have exhibited a trade off between good aspect ratio and ordered layout. The new Split Layout is compared to five published treemap algorithms. Properties such as avarage aspect ratio, stability, run time and readability are measured, and it is shown that the new Split Layout performs better than any known ordered layout. The average aspect ratio is about 23% better and the stability increased between 28% and 40%. A user study was performed to measure the quality of the ordering of the new algorithm. 30 users gave a total of 360 measured response times, and it was found that the median time to locate a specific rectangle in the treemap only took 0.14 seconds (5%) longer for the Split Layout than for the Pivot by Split Size algorithm. The technique was implemented on a PDA and used for visualizing threaded discussion forums. User studies confirm that the concept on using treemaps on PDAs looks promising. The contents of the forum was easily grasped, even though the number of articles exceeded one hundred."
552,Structural Decomposition Trees,"Researchers and analysts in modern industrial and academic environments are faced with a daunting amount of multi-dimensional data. While there has been significant development in the areas of data mining and knowledge discovery, there is still the need for improved visualizations and generic solutions. The state-of-the-art in visual analytics and exploratory data visualization is to incorporate more profound analysis methods while focusing on fast interactive abilities. The common trend in these scenarios is to either visualize an abstraction of the data set or to better utilize screen-space. This paper presents a novel technique that combines clustering, dimension reduction and multi-dimensional data representation to form a multivariate data visualization that incorporates both detail and overview. This amalgamation counters the individual drawbacks of common projection and multi-dimensional data visualization techniques, namely ambiguity and clutter. A specific clustering criterion is used to decompose a multi-dimensional data set into a hierarchical tree structure. This decomposition is embedded in a novel Dimensional Anchor visualization through the use of a weighted linear dimension reduction technique. The resulting Structural Decomposition Tree (SDT) provides not only an insight of the data set's inherent structure, but also conveys detailed coordinate value information. Further, fast and intuitive interaction techniques are explored in order to guide the user in highlighting, brushing, and filtering of the data."

555,De ware geschiedenis van de Boom van Pythagoras,"The Pythagoras tree is a plane fractal constructed from squares. Invented by the Dutch mathematics teacher Albert E. Bosman in 1942, it is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras because each triple of touching squares encloses a right triangle, in a configuration traditionally used to depict the Pythagorean theorem."
556,ShamsehTrees: Providing Hierarchical Context for Nodes of Interest,"Visualizations of hierarchical data usually focus on conveying structure. However, with really large hierarchies, layouts tend to become overcrowded, making it difficult to see details about specific nodes. In contrast, ShamsehTrees focus on layouts centered on a node of interest, provide interactive nested layouts that were inspired by artistic and natural floral patterns, and make use of the natural symmetries in phyllotactic patterns. Instead of emphasizing overall tree structure, these layouts are created to make the most space available for the node of interest. The basic layout is comprised of nested circles that are centered on the node of interest. After selecting a new node of interest, the resizing and repositioning of nodes is animated as they transition to the new layout."
557,Symmetry and Node Focused Visualization of Large Trees,"In this paper, we take a different approach to visualizing very large trees. To facilitate presentation and exploration of massive hierarchical datasets such as linguistic and genealogical hierarchies, our approach considers drawing layouts of tree-cuts as a function of a node-of-interest or NOI, and uses interaction to support rapid access to the entire tree. Instead of emphasizing overall tree structure, our layout is designed to make the most space available for the node-of-interest and its immediate ancestors and descendants. Inspired from Persian floral patterns, we describe the development of ShamsehTree and PaisleyTree, showing how the use of symmetry can provide new structures for tree layouts."
558,PaisleyTrees: A Size-Invariant Tree Visualization,"Squeezing large tree structures into suitable visualizations has been a perennial problem. In response to this challenge, we present PaisleyTrees, a size-invariant tree visualization. PaisleyTrees integrate node-of-interest focus with tree-cut presentations to support rapid tree navigation without resorting to zooming and panning. This visualization offers the ability to work with trees of arbitrary depth and breadth, and maintains legibility for displayed elements. These advantages are achieved by using a hybrid layout, inspired by traditional Paisley patterns, that combines node-link, nested and djacency-based tree layout techniques, and offers both depth and breadth elision."
559,Visualization of Strandtexttrademark ~processes,"The paper describes a visualization tool that uses polar coordinates to create a circular shaped layout of large call trees of Strand programs. Due to the enormous amount of processes which are generated during execution of parallel Strand programs, conventional techniques to display call trees are over-charged. Because of this the tool `Polaranimation' was developed and implemented. One of its prominent features is the ability to display the complete call tree without loosing any vital information. Additionally, it provides debugging facilities and supports the performance tuning of parallel programs. A number of Strand programs have been written and a performance evaluation and comparison guided by `Polaranimation' was conducted."
560,Wordle,"Visualization is the graphic presentation of data -- portrayals meant to reveal complex information at a glance. Think of the familiar map of the New York City subway system, or a diagram of the human brain. Successful visualizations are beautiful not only for their aesthetic design, but also for elegant layers of detail that efficiently generate insight and new understanding. This book examines the methods of two dozen visualization experts who approach their projects from a variety of perspectives -- as artists, designers, commentators, scientists, analysts, statisticians, and more. Together they demonstrate how visualization can help us make sense of the world. Contributors include: Nick Bilton, Michael E. Driscoll, Jonathan Feinberg, Danyel Fisher, Jessica Hagy, Gregor Hochmuth, Todd Holloway, Noah Iliinsky, Eddie Jabbour, Valdean Klump, Aaron Koblin, Robert Kosara, Valdis Krebs, JoAnn Kuchera-Morin et al., Andrew Odewahn, Adam Perer, Anders Persson, Maximilian Schich, Matthias Shapiro, Julie Steele, Moritz Stefaner, Jer Thorp, Fernanda Viegas, Martin Wattenberg, and Michael Young."
561,Optimal Tree Layout (Preliminary Version),"We consider the problem of finding a minimal cost layout of a tree in Euclidian d-space. A tree is an acyclic undirected edge-weighted graph, and a layout is an assignment of a point in d-dimensional Euclidian space to each of the nodes of the tree. The ``length'' of an edge in the layout is the “distance” between its endpoints as measured by some norm. The cost of an edge is its length times its weight, and the cost of the whole layout is the sum of the costs of all the edges. We assume the positions of certain nodes are fixed in advance, and we wish to place the remaining nodes so as to minimize the cost of the layout."
562,ClockMap: Enhancing Circular Treemaps with Temporal Glyphs for Time-Series Data,"Treemaps are a powerful method to visualize especially time-invariant hierarchical data. Most attention is drawn to rectangular treemaps, because their space-filling layouts provide good scalability with respect to the amount of data that can be displayed. Since circular treemaps sacrifice the space-filling property and since higher level circles only approximately match the aggregated size of their descendants, they are rarely used in practice. However, for drawing circular glyphs their shape preserving property can outweigh these disadvantages and facilitate comparative tasks within and across hierarchy levels. The interactive ClockMap visualization effectively supports the user in exploring and finding patterns in hierarchical time-series data through drill-down, semantic zoom and details-on-demand. In this study, the technique's applicability is demonstrated on a real-world dataset about network traffic of a large computer network and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed in the context of alternative layouts."
563,RECIT: REpr'esentation Cartographique et Insulaire de Textes,"Experiences show that most readers are lost in electronic text, because they lack of global information. As a consequence, many people print electronic texts before reading them. This strange phenomenon was not predicted in the past and it could preclude the expansion of electronic reading. We propose here a way to provide some visualization of the structure of the document. That corresponds to the cartography of its overall organization. Our hope is that it could help to orient in electronic texts and consequently to facilitate electronic reading. This paper describes the origins of difficulties and then it presents all the technical details of the proposed solution."
564,AC$^3$ - Automatic Cartography of Cultural Contents,"Experiences with e-books show that the principle obstacle to electronic reading is neither the weight, nor the autonomy or the discomfort of reading on screen, but the absence of reference mark which makes it possible to replace the current window of reading in the whole of the book. We present an automatic cartography of electronic documents which constitutes an attempt to facilitate navigation, reading and memorization of contents. It is to automatically build a singular picture which is designed to be associated to our remembering of each document, i.e. to our mental image. This picture corresponds to the cartography of an island. Its shape is build from the document structure; its coloring reflects the affective content of the text extracted by keywords spotting techniques while icons associated to document topics are added to textual legends as in ancient geographical maps."
565,Memory Islands -- Ontology display,"With the concept of Memory Islands, the ACASA team propose a new tree visualization approach that is based on cartography, i.e. on a spatialization of abstract data structures, mainly trees. The hypothesis on which the notion Memory Island is based is that the spatialization helps to memorize contents. This notion of Memory Island is applied to ontology visualization, which could help to access to many online documents."

567,Planar Upward Tree Drawings with Planar Area,"Rooted trees are usually drawn planar and upward, i.e., without crossings and with-out any parent placed below its child. In this paper we investigate the area requirement of planar upward drawings of rooted trees. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the area of various types of drawings, and provide linear-time algorithms for constructing optimal area drawings. Let T be a bounded-degree rooted tree with N nodes. Our results are summarized as follows: We show that T admits a planar polyline upward grid drawing with area O(N), and with width O(N*alpha) for any prespecified constant a such that 0<alpha<1. If T is a binary tree, we show that T admits a planar orthogonal upward grid drawing with area O (N log log N). We show that if T is ordered, it admits an O(N log N)-area planar upward grid drawing that preserves the left-to-right ordering of the children of each node. We show that all of the above area bounds are asymptotically optimal in the worst case. We present O(N)-time algorithms for constructing each of the above types of drawings of T with asymptotically optimal area. We report on the experimentation of our algorithm for constructing planar polyline upward grid drawings, performed on trees with up to 24 million nodes."
568,Weighted Maps: Location-aware Treemaps,"The wide availability of quantitative geolocated structured data, e.g. census data, makes it desirable for classic tree visualizations to be location-aware. In this paper, we introduce a new treemap algorithm that produces rectangular cartograms consistently with the known location of data points on a geographic map."
569,Weighted Maps: Treemap visualization of geolocated quantitative data,"A wealth of census data relative to hierarchical administrative subdivisions are now available. It is therefore desirable for hierarchical data visualization techniques, to offer a spatially consistent representation of such data. This paper focuses on a widely used technique for hierarchical data, namely treemaps, with a particular emphasis on a specific family of treemaps, designed to take into account spatial constraints in the layout, called Spatially Dependent Treemap (SDT). The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we present the ``Weighted Maps'', a novel SDT layout algorithm and discuss the algorithmic differences with the other state-of-the-art SDT algorithms. Second, we present the quantitative results and analyses of a number of metrics that were used to assess the quality of the resulting layouts. The analyses are illustrated with figures generated from various datasets. Third, we show that the Weighted Maps algorithm offers a significant advantage for the layout of large flat cartograms and multilevel hierarchies having a large branching factor."
570,Drawing a Tree as a Minimum Spanning Tree Approximation,"We introduce and study (1+e)-EMST drawings, i.e. planar straight-line drawings of trees such that, for any fixed e>0, the distance between any two vertices is at least 1/1+e the length of the longest edge in the path connecting them. (1+e)-EMST drawings are good approximations of Euclidean minimum spanning trees. While it is known that only trees with bounded degree have a Euclidean minimum spanning tree realization, we show that every tree T has a (1+e)-EMST drawing for any given e>0. We also present drawing algorithms that compute (1+e)-EMST drawings of trees with bounded degree in polynomial area. As a byproduct of one of our techniques, we improve the best known area upper bound for Euclidean minimum spanning tree realizations of complete binary trees."

As a byproduct of one of our techniques, we improve the best known area upper bound for Euclidean minimum spanning tree realizations of complete binary trees."
572,Bubble Treemaps for Uncertainty Visualization,"We present a novel type of circular treemap, where we intentionally allocate extra space for additional visual variables. With this extended visual design space, we encode hierarchically structured data along with their uncertainties in a combined diagram. We introduce a hierarchical and force-based circle-packing algorithm to compute Bubble Treemaps, where each node is visualized using nested contour arcs. Bubble Treemaps do not require any color or shading, which offers additional design choices. We explore uncertainty visualization as an application of our treemaps using standard error and Monte Carlo-based statistical models. To this end, we discuss how uncertainty propagates within hierarchies. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of our visualization using three different examples: the package structure of Flare, the S&P 500 index, and the US consumer expenditure survey."
573,Embedding Tree Structures in VLSI Hexagonal Arrays,"Tree structures have been proposed for special-purpose and general-purpose multiprocessors due to their desirable property of logarithmic path from the root to any leaf element. Since only local communication among processors is needed in tree structures, they are well suited for the VLSI technology. Such an implementation requires an area-economical mapping of a tree on a plane. Novel mapping schemes for trees onto hexagonal arrays (or grids) and appropriate algorithms are proposed here and shown to be superior over known mappings on square arrays (or grids)."
574,Efficient Embeddings of Binary Trees in VLSI Arrays,"We consider the problem of embedding a complete binary tree in squareor hexagonally-connected VLSI arrays Of processing elements (PE's). This problem can be solved in a radically different manner from current layout techniques which are aimed at laying out a given graph in the plane. The difference is due to the fact that a PE can be used both as a tree node and as a connecting element between distant nodes. New embedding schemes are presented in which (asymptotically) 100 percent of the PE's are utilized as tree nodes. This is a significant savings over known schemes, which achieve 50 percent utilization (the well-known H-tree) and 71 percent for some hexagonal schemes. These schemes also speed up signal propagation from the root to the leaves."
575,Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps: A Visualization Technique for Time-Varying Hierarchical Data,"Treemaps are a widely used technique for the visualization of hierarchical data. In general, these techniques perform a space-filling recursive subdivision of a 2D space where the sizes of the created regions correspond to values of a particular data attribute. Several subdivision algorithms have been proposed to optimize specific criteria, such as region aspect ratio or stability. However, these goals are often contradictory. For example, existing layout algorithms that optimize for aspect ratio -- important for legibility -- are typically not stable. For this reason, Treemaps are rarely used in animated displays of time-variant data. When they are applied to dynamic data sets, unstable Treemap layout algorithms produce poorly animated transitions that include discontinuous jumps in region position when values change. This paper introduces a new technique called Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps. Our layout algorithm is specifically designed to support smooth, real-time animation of time varying hierarchical data while maintaining desirable aspect ratios. We describe our novel approach and outline how it overcomes key limitations of prior Voronoi-based Treemap work to enable the visualization of dynamic data. Results from an evaluation study of the technique are provided along with a brief use case highlighting a real-world application of Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps."
576,"Evaluating a System for Interactive Exploration of Large, Hierarchically Structured Document Repositories","The InfoSky visual explorer is a system enabling users to interactively explore large, hierarchically structured document collections. Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. Documents of similar content are placed close to each other and displayed as stars, while collections of documents at a particular level in the hierarchy are visualised as bounding polygons. Usability testing of an early prototype implementation of InfoSky revealed several design issues which prevented users from fully exploiting the power of the visual metaphor. Evaluation results have been incorporated into an advanced prototype, and another usability test has been conducted. A comparison of test results demonstrates enhanced system performance and points out promising directions for further work."
577,Unit-length embedding of binary trees on a square grid,"We give a proof of the fact that determining whether or not a given binary tree has a grid embedding with edges of unit length is an NP-complete problem. The proof follows an idea indicated by Bhatt and Cosmadakis in [1], which has been implemented using a new building block called U-tree."
578,Bubble Tree Drawing Algorithm,"In this paper, we present an algorithm, called Bubble Tree, for the drawing of general rooted trees. A large variety of algorithms already exists in this field. However, the goal of this algorithm is to obtain a better drawing which makes a trade off between the angular resolution and the length of the edges. We show that the Bubble Tree drawing algorithm provides a planar drawing with at most one bend per edge in linear running time."
579,Visualization of attributed hierarchical structures in a spatiotemporal context,"When visualizing data, spatial and temporal references of these data often have to be considered in addition to the actual data attributes. Nowadays, structural information is becoming more and more important. Hierarchies, for instance, are frequently applied to make large and complex data manageable. Hence, a visual depiction of hierarchical structures in space and time is required. While there are several techniques addressing specific aspects of spatiotemporal visualization, approaches that cope with space, time, data, and structure are rare. With this paper we take a step to fill this gap. By combining various well-established concepts we achieve a reasonably complete visualization of all of the aforementioned aspects, where our focus is on hierarchical structures. We embed hierarchies directly into regions of a map display using variants of the point-based layout. Layering and animation are applied to visualize temporal aspects. Depending on analysis goals, users can switch between representations that emphasize data attributes or hierarchical structures. Interaction techniques support users in navigating the data and their visualization. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by adapting it to implement a visualization for spatio-temporal human health data."
580,Visualization of Varying Hierarchies by Stable Layout of Voronoi Treemaps,"Space-restricted techniques for visualizing hierarchies generally achieve high scalability and readability (e.g., tree maps, bundle views, sunburst). However, the visualization layout directly depends on the hierarchy, that is, small changes to the hierarchy can cause wide-ranging changes to the layout. For this reason, it is difficult to use these techniques to compare similar variants of a hierarchy because users are confronted with layouts that do not expose the expected similarity. Voronoi treemaps appear to be promising candidates to overcome this limitation. However, existing Voronoi treemap algorithms do not provide deterministic layouts or assume a fixed hierarchy. In this paper we present an extended layout algorithm for Voronoi treemaps that provides a high degree of layout similiarity for varying hierarchies, such as software-system hierarchies. The implementation uses a deterministic initial-distribution approach that reduces the variation in node positioning even if changes in the underlying hierarchy data occur. Compared to existing layout algorithms, our algorithm achieves lower error rates with respect to node areas in the case of weighted Voronoi diagrams, which we show in a comparative study."
581,Hybrid-Treemap Layouting,"This paper presents an approach for hybrid treemaps, which applies and combines several different layout principles within a single tree map in contrast to traditional treemap variants based on a single layout concept. To this end, we analyze shortcomings of state-of-the-art treemap algorithms such as Moore, Voronoi and Strip layouts. Based on a number of identified edge cases, we propose a combination of these different layout algorithms, individually selected for and applied on each sub hierarchy of the given treemap data. The selection decision is based on the number of items to be layouted as well as the aspect ratio of the containing visual elements. Futhermore, a layout quality score based on existing treemap layout metrics (e.g., average distance change, relative direction change, average aspect ratio) has been used to evaluate the results of the proposed hybrid layout algorithm and to demonstrate its usefulness applied on representative hierarchical data sets."
582,Large tree structure visualization and display system,"System for the visualization of a large tree structure in which the selection of a center object (40) amongst the objects of the large tree structure enables n levels of descendants from the center object to be visualized on a screen together with the center object, the system has a visualization control in computer memory enabling the objects of a given level corresponding to the children of a parent object of the immediate higher level to be visualized in a fan-shaped area centered around the parent object. A scrollbar associated with the parent object enables all the children of a parent object to be scrolled in a fan. Fan control buttons on the screen enable the aperture of the fans to be modified so that a variable number of children can be visualized in each fan."
583,Beamtrees: Compact Visualization of Large Hierarchies,"Beamtrees are a new method for the visualization of large hierarchical data sets. Nodes are shown as stacked circular beams, such that both the hierarchical structure as well as the size of nodes are depicted. The dimensions of beams are calculated using a variation of the treemap algorithm. A small user study indicated that beamtrees are significantly more effective than nested treemaps and cushion treemaps for the extraction of global hierarchical information."
584,RELT -- Visualizing Trees on Mobile Devices,"The small screens on increasingly used mobile devices challenge the traditional visualization methods designed for desktops. This paper presents a method called ""Radial Edgeless Tree"" (RELT) for visualizing trees in a 2-dimensional space. It combines the existing connection tree drawing with the space-filling approach to achieve the efficient display of trees in a small geometrical area, such as the screen that are commonly used in mobile devices. We recursively calculate a set of non-overlapped polygonal nodes that are adjacent in the hierarchical manner. Thus, the display space is fully used for displaying nodes, while the hierarchical relationships among the nodes are presented by the adjacency (or boundary-sharing) of the nodes. It is different from the other traditional connection approaches that use a node-link diagram to present the parent-child relationships which waste the display space. The hierarchy spreads from north-west to south-east in a top-down manner which naturally follows the traditional way of human perception of hierarchies. We discuss the characteristics, advantages and limitations of this new technique and suggestions for future research."
585,A Mobile Interface for Hierarchical Information Visualization and Navigation,"There is a dramatic increase in the population who use mobile computing devices. Though the hardware becomes more powerful, effective support for information rendering on small screens very much lags behind. To display hierarchical information, researchers have proposed many algorithms for desktop screen visualization. Such algorithms are generally divided into connection and enclosure. Connection approach displays hierarchy with a clear structure but consume display area. Enclosure can maximally utilize the screen space but the layout is essentially implicit. This paper describes a new Radial Edgeless Tree (RELT) for visualizing hierarchical data on palm sized devices. The aim of RELT is to combine the advantages of connection and enclosure approaches. By recursively partitioning the display area, this technique maximizes the space usage. The structural clarity of layout can be reached by arranging location of non-overlapping regions. RELT can be adapted for visualizing structural information for various applications."
586,Managing Hierarchical Information on Small Screens,"This paper presents a visualization methodology called Radial Edgeless Tree (RELT) for visualizing and navigating hierarchical information on mobile interfaces. RELT is characterized by recursive division of a polygonal display area, space-filling, maximum screen space usage, and clarity of the hierarchical structure. It is also general and flexible enough to allow users to customize the root location and stylize the layout. The paper presents the general RELT drawing algorithm that is adaptable and customizable for different applications. We demonstrate the algorithm's application for stock market visualization, and also present an empirical study on an emulated implementation with a currently used cell phone interface in terms of their performances in finding desired information."
587,Visualizing and Navigating Hierarchical Information on Mobile User Interfaces,"This paper presents a visualization approach called Radial Edgeless Tree (RELT) for visualizing and navigating hierarchical information on small screens. Major advantages of the RELT approach include: elegance recursive division of the display area, space-filling, maximum usage of screen estate, and clarity of the hierarchical structure. It offers the flexibility such that users can customize the hierarchy's root location and stylize the layout. The RELT drawing algorithm is adaptable and customizable for different application domains. We have implemented the RELT interface on the Google Android emulator. The paper presents the Android implementation, and then provides an analytical and empirical comparison of the Android implementation with a traditional cell phone interface in terms of their performances in navigating hierarchical information."
588,An algorithm for blob hierarchy layout,"We present an algorithm for the aesthetic drawing of basic hierarchical blob structures, of the kind found in higraphs and statecharts and in other diagrams in which hierarchy is depicted as topological inclusion. Our work could also be useful in window system dynamics, and possibly also in things like newspaper layout, etc. Several criteria for aesthetics are formulated, and we discuss their motivation, our methods of implementation and the algorithm's performance."

590,A linear algorithm for compact box-drawings of trees,"In a box-drawing of a rooted tree, each node is drawn by a rectangular box of prescribed size, no two boxes overlap each other, all boxes corresponding to siblings of the tree have the same x-coordinate at their left sides, and a parent node is drawn at a given distance apart from its first child. A box drawing of a tree is compact if it attains the minimum possible rectangular area enclosing the drawing. We give a linear-time algorithm for finding a compact box-drawing of a tree. A known algorithm does not always find a compact box-drawing and takes time $O(n^2)$ if a tree has n nodes."

A known algorithm does not always find a compact box-drawing and takes time $O(n^2)$ if a tree has n nodes."
592,A novel method for large tree visualization,"Many genomic and proteomic analyses generate as a result a tree of genes or proteins. These trees are often large (containing tens of thousands of nodes and edges), and need a visualization tool to fully display all the information contained in the tree. Clustering analysis can be performed on these trees to obtain clusters of proteins, and we need an efficient way to visualize the clustering results. We present a novel tree visualization tool to help with such analyses."
593,"DOITrees Revisited: Scalable, Space-Constrained Visualization of Hierarchical Data","This paper extends previous work on focus+context visualizations of tree-structured data, introducing an efficient, space-constrained, multi-focal tree layout algorithm (TreeBlock) and techniques at both the system and interactive levels for dealing with scale. These contributions are realized in a new version of the Degree-Of-Interest Tree browser, supporting real-time interactive visualization and exploration of data sets containing on the order of a million nodes."
594,"Method, apparatus, and program product for visualizing tree structured information","Apparatus, methods, and computer program products are disclosed that perform computationally efficient layout of hierarchical data structures."
595,Drawing Contour Trees in the Plane,"The contour tree compactly describes scalar field topology. From the viewpoint of graph drawing, it is a tree with attributes at vertices and optionally on edges. Standard tree drawing algorithms emphasize structural properties of the tree and neglect the attributes. Applying known techniques to convey this information proves hard and sometimes even impossible. We present several adaptions of popular graph drawing approaches to the problem of contour tree drawing and evaluate them. We identify five aesthetic criteria for drawing contour trees and present a novel algorithm for drawing contour trees in the plane that satisfies four of these criteria. Our implementation is fast and effective for contour tree sizes usually used in interactive systems (around 100 branches) and also produces readable pictures for larger trees, as is shown for a $sim 800$ branch example."
596,Skeletal images as visual cues in graph visualization,"The problem of graph layout and drawing is fundamental to many aproaches to the visualization of relational information structures. As the data set grows, the visualization problem is compounded by the need to reconcile the user's need for orientation cues with the danger of information overload. Put simply: How can we limit the number of visual elements on the screen so as not to overwhelm the user yet retain enough information that the user is able to navigate and explore the data set confidently? How can we provide orientational cues so that a user can understand the location of the current viewpoint in a large data set? These are problems inherent not only to graph drawing but information visualization in general. We propose a method which extracts the significant features of a directed acyclic graph as the basis for navigation"
597,Latour -- A Tree Visualisation System,"This paper presents some of the most important features of a tree visualisation system called Latour, developed for the purposes of information visualisation. This system includes a number of interesting and unique characteristics, for example the provision for visual cues based on complexity metrics on graphs, which represent general principles that, in our view, graph based information visualisation systems should generally offer."
598,Graph Visualization and Navigation in Information Visualization: A Survey,"This is a survey on graph visualization and navigation techniques, as used in information visualization. Graphs appear in numerous applications such as Web browsing, state-transition diagrams, and data structures. The ability to visualize and to navigate in these potentially large, abstract graphs is often a crucial part of an application. Information visualization has specific requirements, which means that this survey approaches the results of traditional graph drawing from a different perspective."
599,Embeddings of complete binary trees into extended grids with edge-congestion 1,"Let G and H be two simple, undirected graphs. An embedding of the graph G into the graph H is an injective mapping f from the vertices of G to the vertices of H, together with a mapping which assigns to each edge [u, v] of G a path between f (u) and f (v) in H. The extended grid EM(r, s) is the graph whose vertex set is the set of pairs on nonnegative integers, (i, j) : 0 <= i < r, 0 <= j < s, in which there is an edge between vertices (i, j) and (k, l) if and only if |I - k| <= 1 and |j - l| <= 1. In this paper, we give an embedding of any complete binary tree of odd height into its optimal square extended grid. This embedding has edge-congestion 1, dilation 2^(n-2) + 1, and its average dilation is less than 1.12. We also show that an embedding of a complete binary tree of odd height into its optimal grid, which is obtained from the embedding into the optimal extended grid by a simple transformation, has edge-congestion 2, dilation 2^(n-1), and it creates in the grid far fewer edges of congestion 2 than the embedding from Zienicke (1990)."
600,Tree visualization system and method based upon a compressed half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry,"A node-link structure is displayed within a display area, having a narrow rectangular shape with an edge along one side acting as a horizon of a hyperbolic space half-plane. Lower level node features that share a parent node feature have centers of area positioned on the display in order along a line parallel with the horizon, with sufficiently similar spacings along an axis perpendicular to the horizon from the region around a parent node feature, and with sufficiently similar spacings in a dimension parallel to the horizon from adjacent node features along the line, that the lower level node features sharing the parent node feature are perceptible as a group of related node features. The half-plane model with compression is used for layout of the node-link data, and the hyperbolic layout data is mapped to a Euclidean space for display."
601,Bubble Hierarchies,"We introduce bubble hierarchies as an approach to generating algorithmic art from random hierarchies. The technique is based on repeatedly drawing color-coded circles to illustrate parent--child relationships. The algorithm is simple and produces densely packed structures similar to the concept of Apollonian gaskets. We demonstrate the influence of different parameters on the visual outcome, such as the number of created circles or the color encoding. Our algorithm also supports multiple seeding points and obstacles that can be used to influence the layout of the hierarchy."
602,Visual Realism for the Visualization of Software Metrics,"The visualization techniques used in current software visualization frameworks make use of a limited set of graphical elements to highlight relevant aspects of a software system. Typical examples of such elements are text, simple geometric shapes and uniform color fills. Although human visual perception enables rapid processing of additional visual cues like shading and texture, they are not used. We contend that such 2D and 3D computer graphics techniques for achieving visual realism can be used to increase the information throughput of software visualization techniques. Visualization results are presented to show how treemaps, cushions, color, texture, and bump mapping can be used to visualize software metrics of hierarchically organized elements of a software system"
603,PolyPlane: An Implementation of a New Layout Algorithm For Trees In Three Dimensions,
604,Drawing Trees Symmetrically in Three Dimensions,"Symmetric graph drawing enables a clear understanding of the structure of the graph. Previous work on symmetric graph drawing has focused on two dimensions. Symmetry in three dimensions is much richer than that of two dimensions. This is the first paper to extend symmetric graph drawing into three dimensions. More specifically, the paper investigates the problem of drawing trees symmetrically in three dimensions. First, we suggest a model for drawing trees symmetrically in three dimensions. Based on this model, we present a linear time algorithm for finding the maximum number of three-dimensional symmetries in trees. We also present a three-dimensional symmetric drawing algorithm for trees."
605,Visualizing Biodiversity with Voronoi Treemaps,"Introduced in 2005, the Voronoi treemap algorithm is an information visualization technique for displaying hierarchical data. Voronoi treemaps use weighted, centroidal Voronoi diagrams to create a nested tessellation of convex polygons. However, despite appealing qualities, few real world examples of Voronoi treemaps exist. In this paper, we present a multi-touch tabletop application called Involv that uses the Voronoi treemap algorithm to create an interactive visualization for the Encyclopedia of Life. Involv is the result of a year-long iterative development process and includes over 1.2 million named species organized in a nine-level hierarchy. Working in the domain of life sciences, we have encountered the need to display supplemental hierarchical data to augment information in the treemap. Thus we propose an extension of the Voronoi treemap algorithm that employs force-directed graph drawing techniques both to guide the construction of the treemap and to overlay a supplemental hierarchy."
606,The Binary Tree as an Interconnection Network: Applications to Multiprocessor Systems and VLSI,"The binary tree is a natural way to organize complex computations by a computer. For problems that can be naturally divided into a tree structure, a great deal of parallelism may be employed. In this paper we examine several aspects of the binary tree structure as it relates to both multiprocessor systems and to VISI circuit design. First, we present an algorithm for mapping an arbitrary binary tree onto the plane. An analysis shows the density of this mapping. Second, we consider the problem of routing messages within a binary tree under the assumption that certain nodes may be faulty. Finally, we analyze the binary tree's capacity to transfer information between nodes and we compare it to the capacity of the linear array and the grid."
607,Three-Dimensional EncCon Tree,"This paper describes a three-dimensional extension of a enclosure+connection layout technique, called EncCon tree. The three-dimensional visualization includes layout and navigation. The layout algorithm directly generalizes the two-dimensional EncCon tree layout algorithm to three-dimensional space in which nodes at the same level of the hierarchy are placed onto the same plane. The interactive navigation uses standard three-dimensional viewing techniques which include view transformation, rotation and zoom."
608,Creating Visual Browsers for Large-Scale Online Auctions,"This chapter discusses the requirements raised for running online auctions as well as the technical issues on the design of graphical user interfaces and how we could use these graphical interfaces to help users navigate visualization technique called EncCon as well as the design of graphic attributes that can be used to present the domain specific attributes of the auction items and the relational structures among these items, and these graphic presentations will provide users with a clear map showing the possible paths to the target items. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by illustrating an online auction prototype that simulates the ordinary auction activities with the assistance of visualization."
609,TreemapBar: Visualizing Additional Dimensions of Data in Bar Chart,"Bar chart is a very common and simple graph that is mainly used to visualize simple x, y plots of data for numerical comparisons by partitioning the categorical data values into bars and typically limited to operate on highly aggregated dataset. In today's growing complexity of business data with multi dimensional attributes using bar chart itself is not sufficient to deal with the representation of such business dataset and it also not utilizes the screen space efficiently.Nevertheless, bar chart is still useful because of its shape create strong visual attention to users at first glance than other visualization techniques. In this article, we present a treemap bar chart + tablelens interaction technique that combines the treemap and bar chart visualizations with a tablelens based zooming technique that allows users to view the detail of a particular bar when the density of bars increases. In our approach, the capability of the original bar chart and treemaps for representing complex business data is enhanced and the utilization of display space is also optimized."
610,Degree-of-Interest Visualization for Ontology Exploration,"In recent years, improvements in semantic web technologies have given us new expressive description languages for modeling knowledge domains — the so called ontologies. Nevertheless, ontology editors lack of easy and intuitive user interfaces, so that the exploration and creation of ontologies is often too difficult to be efficient. In this short paper, we introduce a new tree widget which utilizes sophisticated visualization and interaction features for ontology exploration and editing as a work in progress study. Due to space limitations we co+ncentrate here on the aspect of ontology browsing."
611,Human perception of structure in shaded space-filling visualizations,"Very early in the object recognition process the human visual system extracts shading information. While shading can enhance the visibility of structures, it can have a negative impact on the judgment of sizes of elements in a structure. In certain visualization systems the underlying hierarchical structure is not noticeably explicit, such as in space-filling techniques. We hypothesize that in such cases, shading can make the structure more explicit. In this paper, we report the results of two experiments designed to investigate the effects of shading information on extracting the structure in space-filling visualizations. In the first experiment subjects performed better with the visualization tool with shading on structure-based tasks. Our results do not show that shading impairs users' judgment on size-based tasks. A subjective evaluation shows that users preferred interacting with the system when shading was available. The second experiment was designed to investigate further users' capacity to identify structural elements within the space-filling visualization. A substructure recognition task was employed in this experiment and results show that users are capable of identifying sub-structures quicker and with fewer errors when the visualization tool was equipped with shading information than without. The results of both experiments provide evidence that shading information can be used to effectively obtain structural information from space-filling visualizations."
612,Ripple Presentation for Tree Structures with Historical Information,"We propose a new method for representing tree structures with historical information. We call this method Ripple Presentation. Categories of nodes are represented by the angles of edges and elapsed time is represented by the length of the edges. In this way, the method can express both the time series and categories, which has been diffic lt to achieve with either tree structures or lists. As a result, users can nderstand the overall information from their viewpoint view and discover target information effectively. We applied the method to trackback links of Weblog articles and the latest articles of News sites using RSS on Web as a resource."
613,Data Jewelry Box: A Graphics Showcase for Large-Scale Hierarchical Data Visualization,"We see many kinds of large-scale hierarchical data in our daily lives, such as file systems of computers, company organizations, and category-based Web search sites such as Yahoo. Most of the GUIs for these data sources first represent a higher level of the data, and provide an interface so that users can select an interesting portion of the data and locally explore the lower levels. On the other hand, there are not many visualization techniques that give an overview of the data by placing all of the lower-level data onto a display region. How can we implement such a technique that represents all the data in one display, just like the showcases of a jewelry store displays all the jewels in the shop? That is the motivation of this research. The report presents a visualization technique that places all of the lowest-level portions of a hierarchical data set on a display space. It first groups icons that denote the lowest-level data, and then generates rectangles that enclose each group of icons. It repeats the process of generating rectangles that enclose the lower-level rectangles, until the highest-level rectangles are enclosed by the largest rectangle. To use the display space most reasonably, our technique efficiently searches for gaps where rectangles can be located without overlapping adjacent rectangles. We use Delaunay triangular meshes that connect the centers of the rectangles to quickly find the gaps."
614,HeiankyoView: Orthogonal Representation of Large-scale Hierarchical Data,"Visualization is very useful for various large-scale computing fields. One of the authors has reported a hierarchical data visualization technique, and applied it to various large-scale computing data including large-scale Web sites, but also for data mining results, Web search queries, network intrusion detection results, and distributed processes. This paper presents the new hierarchical data visualization technique, HeiankyoView, which can be also applied to various large-scale computing fields. It places data items of input data while it packs the items as many as possible in small display areas, and aligns the items along X-axis and Y-axis of the display area. The technique represents nodes of hierarchical data as a set of rectangles, which are parallel to X-axis and Y-axis. Here the technique orthogonally divides the display area by extension lines of edges of previously placed rectangles. By referring the grid-like subspaces of the display area, the technique quickly finds the adequate positions to place remaining rectangles."
615,Hierarchical Data Visualization Using a Fast Rectangle-Packing Algorithm,We present a technique for the representation of large-scale hierarchical data which aims to provide good overviews of complete structures and the content of the data in one display space. The technique represents the data by using nested rectangles. It first packs icons or thumbnails of the lowest-level data and then generates rectangular borders that enclose the packed data. It repeats the process of generating rectangles that enclose the lower-level rectangles until the highest-level rectangles are packed. We present two rectangle-packing algorithms for placing items of hierarchical data onto display spaces. The algorithms refer to Delaunay triangular meshes connecting the centers of rectangles to find gaps where rectangles can be placed. The first algorithm places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the extension of the layout area is minimal. The second algorithm places rectangles by referring to templates describing the ideal positions for nodes of input data. It places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the combination of the layout area and the distances between the positions described in the template and the actual positions is minimal. It can smoothly represent time-varying data by referring to templates that describe previous layout results. It is also suitable for semantics-based or design-based data layout by generating templates according to the semantics or design.
616,Reconfigurable Disc Trees for Visualizing Large Hierarchical Information Space,"We present a new visualization technique, called RDT (Reconfigurable Disc Tree) which can alleviate the disadvantages of cone trees significantly for large hierarchies while maintaining its context of using 3D depth. In RDT, each node is associated with a disc around which its children are placed. Using discs instead of cones as the basic shape in RDT has several advantages: significant reduction of occluded region, sharp increase in number of displayed nodes, and easy projection onto plane without visual overlapping. We show that RDT can greatly enhance user perception by transforming its shapes dynamically in several ways:(1) disc tree which can significantly reduce the occluded region by the foreground objects, (2) compact disc tree which can increase the number of nodes displayed on the screen, and (3) plane disc tree which can be mapped onto the plane without visual overlapping. We describe an implementation of our visualization system called VISIT (Visual Information System for reconfigurable dIsc Tree). It provides 2D and 3D layouts for RDT and various user interface features such as tree reconfiguration, tree transformation, tree shading, viewing transformation, animation, selection and browsing which can enhance the user perception and navigation capabilities. We also evaluate our system using the following three metrics: percentage of occlusion, density of displayed nodes on a screen. number of identifiable nodes."
617,Drawing Trees: How Many Circles to Use?,"In this paper, we proposed a new approach for drawing rooted trees on circles. Previous approaches either draw entire tree on a single circle or draw too many circles that every node and its children are on a new circle. As a result, they only work well on limited kinds of trees. In contrary, our approach adaptively choose how many circles to use based on a single user input and it can be generalized well to all kinds of trees. Our approach has three phases. First, we recursively divide the tree into a hierarchy of subtrees according to the user input. The subtrees are then processed from bottom to top of the hierarchy and each of them is drawn around a separated circle. Finally, layout of subtrees are assembled together to form the layout of the entire tree. Comparing to previous methods, our approach obtains both compact and pleasing tree drawings with less bends. Furthermore, our method naturally supports visualization interactions, such as locally zooming in/out, when user navigates the drawings. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
618,MetNetGE: Visualizing Biological Networks in Hierarchical Views and 3D Tiered Layouts,"Linking experimental data with large-scale biomedical networks is key for achieving new discoveries in system biology research. Visualization tools that facilitate these tasks often result in a dense Web of connections that resembles a tangled hairball and is difficult to interpret. MetNetGE is an interactive pathway navigation tool based on Google Earth that features novel visualization techniques for pathway information display. Instead of simply showing all the pathways in a network in a complex graph, MetNetGE visualizes the entire network of pathways based on the hierarchical pathway ontology using a novel radial space filling (RSF) method. Orbits show when pathways belong to multiple categories. Mapping cumulative experiment statistics on the RSF drawing aids biologists in easily identifying highly activated pathways in an experiment. After identifying key pathways, biologists can fly to the corresponding region and see the detailed pathway and experimental data in an aligned 3D tiered layout with simplified cross-layer connection patterns."
619,Visualizing Multivariate Hierarchic Data Using Enhanced Radial Space-Filling Layout,"Currently, visualization tools for large ontologies (e.g., pathway and gene ontologies) result in a very flat wide tree that is difficult to fit on a single display. This paper develops the concept of using an enhanced radial space-filling (ERSF) layout to show biological ontologies efficiently. The ERSF technique represents ontology terms as circular regions in 3D. Orbital connections in a third dimension correspond to non-tree edges in the ontology that exist when an ontology term belongs to multiple categories. Biologists can use the ERSF layout to identify highly activated pathway or gene ontology categories by mapping experimental statistics such as coefficient of variation and overrepresentation values onto the visualization. This paper illustrates the use of the ERSF layout to explore pathway and gene ontologies using a gene expression dataset from E. coli."
620,MetNetGE: interactive views of biological networks and ontologies,"Linking high-throughput experimental data with biological networks is a key step for understanding complex biological systems. Currently, visualization tools for large metabolic networks often result in a dense web of connections that is difficult to interpret biologically. The MetNetGE application organizes and visualizes biological networks in a meaningful way to improve performance and biological interpretability. MetNetGE is an interactive visualization tool based on the Google Earth platform. MetNetGE features novel visualization techniques for pathway and ontology information display. Instead of simply showing hundreds of pathways in a complex graph, MetNetGE gives an overview of the network using the hierarchical pathway ontology using a novel layout, called the Enhanced Radial Space-Filling (ERSF) approach that allows the network to be summarized compactly. The non-tree edges in the pathway or gene ontology, which represent pathways or genes that belong to multiple categories, are linked using orbital connections in a third dimension. Biologists can easily identify highly activated pathways or gene ontology categories by mapping of summary experiment statistics such as coefficient of variation and overrepresentation values onto the visualization. After identifying such pathways, biologists can focus on the corresponding region to explore detailed pathway structure and experimental data in an aligned 3D tiered layout. In this paper, the use of MetNetGE is illustrated with pathway diagrams and data from E. coli and Arabidopsis. MetNetGE is a visualization tool that organizes biological networks according to a hierarchical ontology structure. The ERSF technique assigns attributes in 3D space, such as color, height, and transparency, to any ontological structure. For hierarchical data, the novel ERSF layout enables the user to identify pathways or categories that are differentially regulated in particular experiments. MetNetGE also displays complex biological pathway in an aligned 3D tiered layout for exploration."
621,Tree-Maps: A space-filling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures,"A method for visualizing hierarchically structured information is described. The tree-map visualization technique makes 100% use of the available display space, mapping the full hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner. This efficient use of space allows very large hierarchies to be displayed in their entirety and facilitates the presentation of semantic information. Tree-maps can depict both the structure and content of the hierarchy. However, the approach is best suited to hierarchies in which the content of the leaf nodes and the structure of the hierarchy are of primary importance, and the content information associated with internal nodes is largely derived from their children."
622,TreeViz: Treemap visualization of hierarchically structured information,"TreeViz is an Apple Macintosh implementation of the treemap technique for visualizing hierarchical information structures. TreeViz enables users to visualize and browse large hierarchically structured information spaces. TreeViz enables the drawing of hierarchies an order of magnitude larger (number of nodes) than is possible with typical presentation methods, given the same display space."
623,Treemaps: Visualizing hierarchical and categorical data,"Treemaps are a graphically based method for the visualization of hierarchical or categorical data spaces. Treemap presentations of data shift mental workload from the cognitive to the perceptual systems, taking advantage of the human visual processing system to increase the bandwidth of the human-computer interface. Efficient use of display space allows for the simultaneous presentation of thousands of data records, as well as facilitating the presentation of semantic information. Treemaps let users see the forest and the trees by providing local detail in the context of a global overview, providing a visually engaging environment in which to analyze, search, explore and manipulate large hierarchical and categorical data spaces. The treemap method of hierarchical visualization, at its core, is based on the property of containment. This property of containment is a fundamental idea which powerfully encapsulates many of our reasons for constructing information hierarchies. All members of the treemap family of algorithms partition multi-dimensional display spaces based on weighted hierarchical data sets. In addition to generating treemaps and standard traditional hierarchical diagrams, the treemap algorithms extend non-hierarchical techniques such as bar and pie charts into the domain of hierarchical presentation. Treemap algorithms can be used to generate bar charts, outlines, traditional 2-D node and link diagrams, pie charts, cone trees, cam trees, drum trees, etc. Generating existing diagrams via treemap transformations is an excercise meant to show the power, ease, and generality with which alternative presentations can be generated from the basic treemap algorithms. Controlled experiments with novice treemap users and real data highlight the strengths of treemaps and provide direction for improvement. Experimental results show that treemaps are a powerful visualization tool for large data sets, significantly reducing user performance times for global comparison tasks. Effective visualizations of large data sets can help users gain insight into relevant features of the data, construct accurate mental models of the information, and locate regions of particular interest. Treemaps are based on simple, fundamental ideas, but they are the building blocks with which an entire world of unique and exciting visualizations can be built."
624,Application of Helix Cone Tree Visualizations to Dynamic Call Graph Illustration,"We describe a tool that enables users to record and visualise runtime behaviour of software applications developed in Java. The execution trace, stored in the form of an XML file is visualized using 3D call graphs that are an extension of the Cone Tree information visualisation technique. This tool gives the user the ability to create several call graph views from a program's execution trace, providing additional representations of the program execution to both novice and expert programmers for the purposes of program execution analysis."
625,Visualization of mappings between the gene ontology and cluster trees,"Ontologies and hierarchical clustering are both important tools in biology and medicine to study high-throughput data such as transcriptomics and metabolomics data. Enrichment of ontology terms in the data is used to identify statistically overrepresented ontology terms, giving insight into relevant biological processes or functional modules. Hierarchical clustering is a standard method to analyze and visualize data to find relatively homogeneous clusters of experimental data points. Both methods support the analysis of the same data set, but are usually considered independently. However, often a combined view is desired: visualizing a large data set in the context of an ontology under consideration of a clustering of the data. This paper proposes a new visualization method for this task."
626,InfoSky: Visual Exploration of Large Hierarchical Document Repositories,
627,Visualization of Complex Structures on Mobile Handhelds,"Information Visualization has become an important research topic in Computer Graphics. One key issue of this topic is the visual presentation of intrinsic structures of complex information spaces. Today nearly all approaches of structure visualization are designed for none-mobile devices such as PCs or workstations. However, mobile handhelds have become more popular in recent years, and are increasingly used in different application domains. Limited resources of these devices require new paradigms for information presentation and interaction such as new methods for structure visualization based on new metaphors for efficient screen space usage. This paper describes how recent techniques of structure visualization can be adapted or redesigned for mobile pocket-sized devices."
628,Generating an Outside-in Hierarchical Tree Visualization,"A data visualization tool (``tool'') configured to generate a visualization for tree data. The tool can calculate a number of hierarchical levels of the tree data. The tool can further subdivide a presentation area for the data visualization into a number of concentric parts. The concentric parts are equivalent to the number of hierarchical levels. Each of the concentric parts corresponds to one of the hierarchical levels. Further, the tool can graphically generate the data visualization for presentation via an electronic display. A first of the concentric parts that corresponds to a highest of the hierarchal levels is an outermost one of the concentric parts in the presentation area. Each successive concentric part inward corresponds to a next lower hierarchical level."
629,Thread Arcs: An email thread visualization,"This paper describes Thread Arcs, a novel interactive visualization technique designed to help people use threads found in email. Thread Arcs combine the chronology of messages with the branching tree structure of a conversational thread in a mixed-model visualization by Venolia and Neustaedter (2003) that is stable and compact. By quickly scanning and interacting with Thread Arcs, people can see various attributes of conversations and find relevant messages in them easily. We tested this technique against other visualization techniques with users' own email in a functional prototype email client. Thread Arcs proved an excellent match for the types of threads found in users' email for the qualities users wanted in small-scale visualizations."
630,Effective Visualization of Hierarchical Graphs With the Cityscape Metaphor,"In this paper, we describe an implementation of the cityscape metaphor to visualize trees. The cityscape metaphor is a generalization of barcharts in 3D. Our approach serves for better exploitation of human perception capabilities. To achieve this we employ effective visual cues like node position and size. We determine node positions in terms of perceptual organization. Further we determine node sizes for providing redundant hierarchical information. Redundancy aides in better understanding the tree structure. Finally, we point out some of the advantages of this approach to other spatial metaphors such as cone trees."
631,Geophylogenies and the Map of Life,"One hundred and fifty years after Charles Darwin wrote his ``Origin of Species'', two major ongoing Web-based scientific projects are collating information on the earth's biological diversity. The Encyclopaedia of Life (EoL) provides a single interface through which information on each being of the same class can be accessed, whereas The Tree of Life (ToL) Web project places these classes onto an evolutionary tree. Here, I propose that a third complementary project should now be considered, the Map of Life (MoL), in which all we know about the biogeographical history of life -- including clades, species, their genes, and the communities they are members of -- is threaded through a dynamic earth history, capturing the spatiotemporal pathways that underlie current and past patterns of biodiversity."
632,"InfoSky: A System for Visual Exploration of Very Large, Hierarchically Structured Knowledge Spaces","This publication presents InfoSky, a system enabling exploration of large, hierarchically structured knowledge spaces. InfoSky employs a two-dimensional graphical representation with variable magnification, much like a real-world telescope, to visualise individual documents as stars, hierarchical structures as constellations, and the whole knowledge repository as a galaxy. Force-directed placement is used to position topically similar documents in geometric adjacency, and modified Voronoi diagrams are employed to construct non-overlapping constellation boundaries, while statistical text processing extracts abstracts and keywords from documents and collections. InfoSky combines hierarchy and topical similarity in a visualisation using a striking, well-known metaphor, providing users with a tool appropriate for today’s large, hierarchically structured document repositories."
633,H-v drawings of binary trees,"This chapter considers h-v drawings of binary trees and presents new results on it. We prove that binary trees with n nodes can be h-v drawn so that the total edge length is O(n log log n), and so that the maximum edge length is O(SQRT(n log n)."
634,"Three-Dimensional Phylogeny Explorer: Distinguishing paralogs, lateral transfer, and violation of ''molecular clock´´ assumption with 3D visualization","Construction and interpretation of phylogenetic trees has been a major research topic for understanding the evolution of genes. Increases in sequence data and complexity are creating a need for more powerful and insightful tree visualization tools. We have developed 3D Phylogeny Explorer (3DPE), a novel phylogeny tree viewer that maps trees onto three spatial axes (species on the X-axis; paralogs on Z; evolutionary distance on Y), enabling one to distinguish at a glance evolutionary features such as speciation; gene duplication and paralog evolution; lateral gene transfer; and violation of the ""molecular clock"" assumption. Users can input any tree on the online 3DPE, then rotate, scroll, rescale, and explore it interactively as ""live"" 3D views. All objects in 3DPE are clickable to display subtrees, connectivity path highlighting, sequence alignments, and gene summary views, and etc. To illustrate the value of this visualization approach for microbial genomes, we also generated 3D phylogeny analyses for all clusters from the public COG database. We constructed tree views using well-established methods and graph algorithms. We used Scientific Python to generate VRML2 3D views viewable in any web browser. 3DPE provides a novel phylogenetic tree projection method into 3D space and its web-based implementation with live 3D features for reconstruction of phylogenetic trees of COG database."
635,Label Embedded Treemapping: A Label Overlap Prevention Technique for Zoomable Treemaps and a User Interaction Technique,"Data navigation of a treemap -- a widely used tool for visualizing tree data -- becomes more difficult as the amount of data increases. To solve this problem, treemap techniques using zoomable user interface (ZUI) methods -- the most typical of which is the zoomable treemap (ZTM) -- have been proposed. However, ZTMs can incur face text overlapping issues between examined nodes. In order to increase ZTM readability, we propose a label embedded tree map technique that prevents label overlapping and a direct node selection method for the highlighting of focused parent nodes. The proposed tree map technique resolves the ZTM label conflict and the direct node selection method can efficiently improve data navigation."
636,Botanical Visualization of Huge Hierarchies,"A new method for the visualization of huge hierarchical data structures is presented. The method is based on the observation that we can easily see the branches, leaves, and their arrangement in a botanical tree, despite of the large number of elements. The strand model of Holton is used to convert an abstract tree into a geometric model. Nonleaf nodes are mapped to branches and child nodes to subbranches. A naive application of this model leads to unsatisfactory results, hence it is tailored to suit our purposes better. Continuing branches are emphasized, long branches are contracted, and sets of leaves are shown as fruit. The method is applied to the visualization of directory structures. The elements, directories and files, as well as their relations can easily be extracted, thereby showing that the use of methods from botanical modeling can be effective for information visualization."
637,Representing Points in Many Dimensions by Trees and Castles,"A number of points in k dimensions are displayed by associating with each point a symbol: a drawing of a tree or a castle. All symbols have the same structure derived from a hierarchical clustering algorithm applied to the k variables (dimensions) over all points, but their parts are coded according to the coordinates of each individual point. Trees and castles show general size effects, the change of whole clusters of variables from point to point, trends, and outliers. They are especially appropriate for evaluating the clustering of variables and for observing clusters of points. Their major advantage over earlier attempts to represent multivariate observations (such as profiles, stars, faces, boxes, and Andrews's curves) lies in their matching of relationships between variables to relationships between features of the representing symbol. Several examples are given, including one with 48 variables."

640,Edge Equalized Treemaps,"Treemap is a visualization method for hierarchical structures in which nodes are drawn as rectangles and arranged in a nested style. Several variations of Treemap have been developed to represent different types of data. In this paper, we propose an Edge Equalized Treemap, a representation that embeds visual data such as a bar chart in leaf rectangles. This representation is characterized by leaf rectangles of equal widths. Because their widths are equal, the scale intervals of charts in a leaf rectangle can be unified, meaning that we can compare charts simply by looking at them. We compare the Edge Equalized Treemap with existing layout methods, and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach."
641,Fractal Approaches for Visualizing Huge Hierarchies,"This paper describes fractal approaches to the problems which associate with visualizing huge hierarchies. The geometrical characteristic of a fractal, self-similarity, allows users to visually interact with a huge tree in the same manner at every level of the tree. The fractal dimension, a measure of complexity, makes it possible to control the total amount of displayed nodes. A prototype visualization system for UNIX directories is also shown."
642,Fractal views: A fractal-based method for controlling information display,"Computer users often must view large amounts of information through video displays which are physically limited in size. Although some methods, which automatically display/erase information units based on their degrees of importance, have been proposed, they lack an ability to keep the total amount of displayed information nearly constant. We propose a new method for information display based on fractal theory. By regarding the information structures used in computers as complex objects, we can abstract these objects as well as control their amount. Using our method, (1) the total amount of information is kept nearly constant even when users change their focuses of attention and (2) this amount can be set flexibly. Through mathematical analysis, we show our method's ability to control the amount. An application to program display is also shown. When this method is applied to the display of structured programs, it provides fisheye-like views which integrate local details around the focal point and major landmarks further away."
643,Improving Stability and Compactness in Street Layout Visualizations,"We present and evaluate improvements for Street Layout, a technique that can be used for visualizing evolving hierarchical data such as file structures or software systems. Street Layouts represent data as street networks, where each street represents a branch of the hierarchy and buildings around streets represent leaves. We extended the initial idea in various ways to increase compactness and visual stability. Our approaches are compared against the current methods in a conducted technical evaluation. A prototypic application shows the applicability of our improvements for visualizing a real world data set."
644,Information visualization using a new focus+context technique in combination with dynamic clustering of information space,"This paper presents work in progress on our approach to visualizing multi-dimensional and hierarchical information. We propose two new graphical user interfaces, the Magic Eye View (MEV) and ShapeVis to explore information spaces. In order to cope with large information sets we combine MEV and ShapeVis with dynamic hierarchical clustering of information units The Magic Eye View, which implements a new Focus+Context technique, is used as the interface for visualizing those hierarchies. In order to support detailed exploration of the information space (e.g analysis of certain cluster nodes or hierarchy levels) a new technique for visualizing multidimensional information is used. ShapeVis provides 2D or 3D representations of the information objects according to the selected subset of the information space Objects are represented as small closed free-form-surfaces. The location, size and shape of these surfaces describe the original objects in the information space uniquely according to their properties."
645,Icicle Plot: Better Displays for Hierarchical Clustering,"An icicle plot is a method for presenting a hierarchical clustering. Compared with other methods of presentation, it is far easier in an icicle plot to read off which objects belong to which clusters, and which objects join or drop out from a cluster as we move up and down the levels of the hierarchy, though these benefits only appear when enough objects are being clustered. Icicle plots are described, and their benefits are illustrated using a clustering of 48 objects."
646,Visualization of Contents Archive by Contour Map Representation,"This article describes a model for sustainable contents management, its visualization algorithms, and the implemented system, called sustainable knowledge globe (SKG). The focal point of our study is visualization using contour maps. The graphical representation of tree-structured contents increases in complexity with the number of contents. The contour map representations can briefly depict the arrangement and structure of contents in an archive. Three contour map representations are proposed assuming the importance of the arrangement design. Nesting, dendroidal, and island-like contours are amplified from the viewpoint of preservation of the structures and arrangements, in addition to supporting shape and texture design. The comparison and applications of the three algorithms are discussed."

648,A visualization by Innovated Squarified Treemap for somatosensory data analysis,"Enormous information in the Internet, especially in the health care field, makes users cannot get the information they want in time. To let medical staffs, even patients and users, absorb and understand information quickly, data visualization converts information to graphic style. However, some treemap algorithms are not suitable for displaying on certain conditions. This study proposes an improved algorithm, Innovated Squarified Treemap (iS qT), to process the information by data visualization. A comparison shows that our iS qT algorithm provides better performance than original Squarified Treemap algorithm. We expect this paper to facilitate the information be read easier by our iS qT approach in the rehabilitation field."
649,Hyperbolic Wheel: A Novel Hyperbolic Space Graph Viewer for Hierarchical Information Content,"Tree and graph structures have been widely used to present hierarchical and linked data. Hyperbolic trees are special types of graphs composed of nodes (points or vertices) and edges (connecting lines), which are visualized on a non-Euclidean space. In traditional Euclidean space graph visualization, distances between nodes are measured by straight lines. Displays of large graphs in Euclidean spaces may not utilize efficiently the available space and may impose limitations on the number of graph nodes. The special hyperbolic space rendering of tree-graphs enables adaptive and efficient use of the available space and facilitates the display of large hierarchical structures. In this paper we report on a newly developed advanced hyperbolic graph viewer, Hyperbolic Wheel, which enables the navigation, traversal, discovery and interactive manipulation of information stored in large hierarchical structures. Examples of such structures include personnel records, disc directory structures, ontological constructs, web-pages and other nested partitions. The Hyperbolic Wheel framework provides an intuitive and dynamic graphical interface to explore and retrieve information about individual nodes (data objects) and their relationships (data associations). The Hyperbolic Wheel is freely available online for educational and research purposes."
650,A focus+context technique based on hyperbolic geometry for visualizing large hierarchies,"We present a new focus+context (fisheye) technique for visualizing and manipulating large hierarchies. Our technique assigns more display space to a portion of the hierarchy while still embedding it in the context of the entire hierarchy. The essence of this scheme is to lay out the hierarchy in a uniform way on a hyperbolic plane and map this plane onto a circular display region. This supports a smooth blending between focus and context, as well as continuous redirection of the focus. We have developed effective procedures for manipulating the focus using pointer clicks as well as interactive dragging, and for smoothly animating transitions across such manipulation. A laboratory experiment comparing the hyperbolic browser with a conventional hierarchy browser was conducted."
651,The Hyperbolic Browser: A Focus+Context Technique for Visualizing Large Hierarchies,"We present a new focus+context technique based on hyperbolic geometry for visualizing and manipulating large hierarchies. Our technique assigns more display space to a portion of the hierarchy while still embedding it in the context of the entire hierarchy. We lay out the hierarchy in a uniform way on a hyperbolic plane and map this plane onto a display region. The chosen mapping provides a fisheye distortion that supports a smooth blending of focus and context. We have deveoped effective procedures for manipulating the focus using pointer clicks as well as interactive dragging and for smoothly animating transitions across such manipulation. Enhancements to the core mechanisms provide support for multiple foci, control of the tradeoff between node density and node display space, and for visualizing graphs by transforming them into trees."
652,Visualizing large trees using the hyperbolic browser,"We demonstrate a focus+context (fisheye) scheme for visualizing and manipulating large hierarchies. Our approach is to lay out the hierarchy uniformly on the hyperbolic plane and map this plane onto a circular display region. The projection onto the disk provides a natural mechanism for assigning more space to a portion of the hierarchy while still embedding it in a much larger context. Change of focus is accomplished by translating the structure on the hyperbolic plane, which allows a smooth transition without compromising the presentation of the context."
653,Layout of node-link structures in space with negative curvature,"Layout data indicate positions in a negatively curved layout space for nodes in a hierarchical branch of a node-link structure. The layout data indicate a parent position for parent nodes and, for children that share a parent node, child positions approximately along a circle in the layout space with the parent position approximately at the circle's center. Adjacent child positions are separated by approximately a base spacing. The radii of circles within the branch together approximate a function that increases slowly with number of child nodes such that the radii and spacings along circles are all approximately uniform within the branch. The layout data can be obtained from data defining the node-link structure. The layout data can be used to perform mappings, each obtaining positions for a subset of the nodes. The layout data can be used to present a first representation of the node-link structure on a display. In response to a user signal indicating a change from a first display position near a first feature to a second display position, a second representation can be presented that is perceptible as a changed continuation of the first. The second representation includes, near the second display position, a second feature representing the same part of the node-link structure as the first feature. The second representation can be obtained by a transformation of the layout space, which can be a discrete approximation of a hyperbolic plane."
654,Displaying node-link structure with region of greater spacings and peripheral branches,"Node-link data defining a node-link structure are used to present a sequence of representations on a display. The last representation in the sequence is perceptible as a changed continuation of the first. Each representation includes bounded node features, each with a center of area and a nearest node spacing that define a mid-spacing circle. All mid-spacing circles together determine an outer convex hull enclosing a total area for the representation. The mid-spacing circles of a subset of more spaced node features determine an inner convex hull enclosing approximately half the total area and enclosing a region in which nearest node spacings are in general perceptibly greater than in another region outside the second convex hull. The node features also represent a peripheral branch with lower level nodes that are not represented by more spaced node features. In the peripheral branch, node features that share a parent have centers of area positioned approximately along an arc with sufficiently similar spacings from the center of area of the parent node feature and from adjacent node features that they are perceptible as a group of related node features. The inner convex hulls of the first and last representations include subsets of node features representing different sets of nodes. The sequence can produce a perception that one node feature's nearest node spacing increases while another's decreases. The representations can be presented by a series of iterations, and can be presented at animation speeds to produce a perception of continuously moving node features."
655,Visualization-based analysis of quality for large-scale software systems,"We propose an approach for complex software analysis based on visualization. Our work is motivated by the fact that in spite of years of research and practice, software development and maintenance are still time and resource consuming, and high-risk activities. The most important reason in our opinion is the complexity of many phenomena related to software, such as its evolution and its reliability. In fact, there is very little theory explaining them. Today, we have a unique opportunity to empirically study these phenomena, thanks to large sets of software data available through open-source programs and open repositories. Automatic analysis techniques, such as statistics and machine learning, are usually limited when studying phenomena with unknown or poorly-understood influence factors. We claim that hybrid techniques that combine automatic analysis with human expertise through visualization are excellent alternatives to them. In this paper, we propose a visualization framework that supports quality analysis of large-scale software systems. We circumvent the problem of size by exploiting perception capabilities of the human visual system."
656,Visual analysis of Azureus using VERSO,"In this challenge report, we will see how to use VERSO in order to analyse Azureus. We answer the challenge through two separate main goals which represent two possible tasks available in VERSO. The first task is design anomaly detection and the second task is evolution analysis."
657,Spherical Layout for 3D Tree Visualization,"The 3D tree visualization faces multiples challenges: the election of an appropriate layout, the use of the interactions that make it easier the data exploration and a metaphor that helps the information understanding. A good combination of these three elements (layout, interactions and metaphor) will result in a visualization that effectively convey the key features of a complex structure or system to a wide range of users and permits the analytical reasoning process. The goal of this work was centered in the 3D tree visualization. In spite of their apparent simplicity, the displaying of a tree in 3D can also introduce new problems that can be overcome with the appropriate interactions. So, we have developed a new visualization technique for 3D tree visualization; this includes the design of a new tree layout that we called Spherical layout and the set of interactions that can be applied on this representation. This technique allows representing hierarchical structures to different levels of detail and also can be used as a visualization technique that allows a tree with attribute to be visualized. The Spherical layout has shown good result for large trees without compromising the performance; this is a key issue in tree visualization."
658,Spherical Layout Implementation using Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations,"The 3D tree visualization faces multiple challenges: the election of an appropriate layout, the use of the interactions that make the data exploration easier and a metaphor that helps in the process of information understanding. A good combination of these elements will result in a visualization that effectively conveys the key features of a complex structure or system to a wide range of users and permits the analytical reasoning process. In previous works we presented the Spherical Layout, a technique for 3D tree visualization that provides an excellent base to achieve those key features. The layout was implemented using the TriSphere algorithm, a method that discretized the spheres's surfaces with triangles to achieve a uniform distribution of the nodes. The goal of this work was centered in a new algorithm for the implementation of the Spherical layout; we called it the Weighted Spherical Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (WSCVT). In this paper we present a detailed description of this new implementation and a comparison with the TriSphere algorithm."
659,User Experience with Spherical Layout,"The 3D tree visualization faces multiples challenges: the selection of an appropriate layout and the use of proper interactions will help the information understanding. A good combination of these two elements (layout + interactions) will result in a visualization that effectively conveys the key features of a complex structure or system to a wide range of users and permits the analytical reasoning process. In previous work we have presented the Spherical layout; this layout allows the representation of larger information sets, at different levels of detail in a 3D environment. The goal of this work was centered in a user experience for this layout. We developed a file browser application based on the Spherical layout, called Brows.AR, and compared it with Windows File Browser. The results of this experience are shown in this paper."
660,Intelligent positioning of items in a tree map visualization,Displaying data from a data set in a tree map visualization is provided by prioritizing the data in the data set so as to associate a priority with respective elements of the data in the data set. A tree map visualization is generated based on the data set where a location of bounding boxes in the tree map is based on the priority associated with the corresponding element. Tree maps having locations of bounding boxes that are based on a priority associated with the bounding boxes are also provided.

662,Det. (Distance Encoded Tree): A Scalable Visualization Tool for Mapping Multiple Traits to Large Evolutionary Trees,"Evolutionary biologists are often interested in finding correlations among biological traits (or attributes) across a number of species, as such correlations may lead to testable hypotheses about the underlying function. Because some species are more closely related than others, computing and visualizing these correlations must be done in the context of the evolutionary tree that relates the species. Although dozens of visualizations for correlated traits have been developed over the decades, the recent explosive growth in the number of traits and species has created a need for a visualization that can scale to dozens of traits mapped to thousands of species and their evolutionary tree to allow the interactive exploration of complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce Det., called detective, an evolutionary tree visualization that allows biologists to see multiple attributes of leaf nodes. We describe a new tree layout algorithm to represent different branch lengths and several visualization and intereaction techniques to address user requirements. We also report informal feedbacks we collected from evolutionary biologists."

Because some species are more closely related than others, computing and visualizing these correlations must be done in the context of the evolutionary tree that relates species. In this note, we introduce PhyloDet (short for PhyloDetective), an evolutionary tree visualization tool that enables biologists to visualize multiple traits mapped to the tree."
664,Visualizing tree structure with different edge lengths,"A system described herein includes a receiver component that receives multiple data elements, wherein each of the data elements has a common attribute, and wherein the several data elements are hierarchically related. The system may further include an assignor component that independently assigns each of the multiple data elements to one of a plurality of layers, wherein a data element is assigned to a layer based at least in part upon a value of the common attribute that corresponds to the data element. The system may also include a renderer component that receives assignments made by the assignor component and graphically renders a tree structure based at least in part upon the assignments. Furthermore, a color bar can be generated that includes one or more rows based at least in part upon content of the tree structure."
665,Angular Treemaps -- A New Technique for Visualizing and Emphasizing Hierarchical Structures,"Space-filling visualization techniques have proved their capability in visualizing large hierarchical structured data. However, most existing techniques restrict their partitioning process in vertical and horizontal direction only, which cause problem with identifying hierarchical structures. This paper presents a new space-filling method named Angular Treemaps that relax the constraint of the rectangular subdivision. The approach of Angular Treemaps utilizes divide and conquer paradigm to visualize and emphasize large hierarchical structures within a compact and limited display area with better interpretability. Angular Treemaps generate various layouts to highlight hierarchical sub-structure based on user's preferences or system recommendations. It offers flexibility to be adopted into a wider range of applications, regarding different enclosing shapes. Preliminary usability results suggest user's performance by using this technique is improved in locating and identifying categorized analysis tasks."
666,Visualizing large trees with divide & conquer partition,"While prior works on enclosure approach, guarantees the space utilization of a single geometrical area, mostly rectangle, this paper proposes a flexible enclosure tree layout method for partitioning various polygonal shapes that break through the limitation of rectangular constraint. Similar to Treemap techniques, it uses enclosure to divide display space into smaller areas for its sub-hierarchies. The algorithm can partition a polygonal shape or even an arbitrary shape into smaller polygons, rotated rectangles or vertical-horizontal rectangles. The proposed method and implementation algorithms provide an effective interactive visualization tool for partitioning large hierarchical structures within a confined display area with different shapes for real-time applications. We demonstrated the effective of the new method with a case study, an automated evaluation and a usability study."
667,Divide and Conquer Treemaps: Visualizing large trees with various shapes,"Most existing treemaps achieve the space utilization of a single geometrical area, mostly rectangle. Limiting visualization to rectangles could block the human capability on graph recognition, including orientation, shape and differentiation etc. To relax rectangular constraint, we propose a flexible enclosure approach with three algorithms. It partitions large hierarchical structures within a confined display area with different shapes for real-time applications. Our approach is based on the combination of Divide-and-Conquer method and the treemap paradigm. The partitioning algorithms generate three types of layouts with polygonal, angular and rectangular titling, which are flexible to be used separately or combined. We present technical details including the visualization results in the experiments and in the cases studies with real data sets. We evaluated the visualization based on graph drawing aesthetics and optimization criteria. Our usability study shows that (1) treemaps with layout variability support utilization of human capability in graph perception and (2) treemaps adopted in different shaped containers could have a positive impact on user satisfaction and awareness during visual data exploration."
668,Visualization of Software and Systems as Support Mechanism for Integrated Software Project Control,"Many software development organizations still lack support for obtaining intellectual control over their software development processes and for determining the performance of their processes and the quality of the produced products. Systematic support for detecting and reacting to critical process and product states in order to achieve planned goals is usually missing. One means to institutionalize measurement on the basis of explicit models is the development and establishment of a so-called Software Project Control Center (SPCC) for systematic quality assurance and management support. An SPCC is comparable to a control room, which is a well known term in the mechanical production domain. One crucial task of an SPCC is the systematic visualization of measurement data in order to provide context-, purpose-, and role-oriented information for all stakeholders (e.g., project managers, quality assurance managers, developers) during the execution of a software development project. The article will present an overview of SPCC concepts, a concrete instantiation that supports goal-oriented data visualization, as well as examples and experiences from practical applications."
669,Mixed-Projection Treemaps: A novel approach mixing 2D and 2.5D Treemaps,"This paper presents a novel technique for combining 2D and 2.5D treemaps using multi-perspective views to leverage the advantages of both treemap types. It enables a new form of overview+detail visualization for tree-structured data and contributes new concepts for real-time rendering of and interaction with treemaps. The technique operates by tilting the graphical elements representing inner nodes using affine transformations and animated state transitions. We explain how to mix orthogonal and perspective projections within a single treemap. Finally, we show application examples that benefit from the reduced interaction overhead."
670,On mapping complete binary trees into grids and extended grids,"We consider one-to-one, congestion one layouts of complete binary trees into 2-D grids and extended 2-D grids. For such a layout of the complete binary tree $T_h$ of height h into the square $ntimes n$ grid we consider the layout's expansion ratio r=n*n/(2^(h+1) -1). For r the least expansion among layouts of $T_h$ into grids, we obtain the bounds 1.122<=r<=1.4656 for large h and n. For layouts into extended grids we similarly obtain bounds 1.03<=r<=1.115. The upper bounds are improvements on previous work, while the lower bounds are the first such to appear."
671,Expansion of layouts of complete binary trees into grids,"Let $T_h$ be the complete binary tree of height h. Let M be the infinite grid graph with vertex set Z^2, where two vertices (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) of M are adjacent if and only if |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|=1. Suppose that T is a tree which is a subdivision of $T_h$ and is also isomorphic to a subgraph of M. Motivated by issues in optimal VLSI design, we show that the point expansion ratio $n(T)/n(T_h)=n(T)/(2^(h+1)-1)$ is bounded below by 1.122 for h sufficiently large. That is, we give bounds on how many vertices of degree 2 must be inserted along the edges of $T_h$ in order that the resulting tree can be laid out in the grid. Concerning the constructive end of VLSI design, suppose that T is a tree which is a subdivision of $T_h$ and is also isomorphic to a subgraph of the $ntimes n$ grid graph. Define the expansion ratio of such a layout to be $n*n/n(T_h)=n*n/(2^(h+1)-1)$. We show constructively that the minimum possible expansion ratio over all layouts of $T_h$ is bounded above by 1.4656 for sufficiently large h. That is, we give efficient layouts of complete binary trees into square grids, making improvements upon the previous work of others. We also give bounds for the point expansion and expansion problems for layouts of Th into extended grids, i.e. grids with added diagonals."
672,On Balloon Drawings of Rooted Trees,"Among various styles of tree drawing, balloon drawing, where each subtree is enclosed in a circle, enjoys a desirable feature of displaying tree structures in a rather balanced fashion. We first design an efficient algorithm to optimize angular resolution and aspect ratio for the balloon drawing of rooted unordered trees. For the case of ordered trees for which the center of the enclosing circle of a subtree need not coincide with the root of the subtree, flipping the drawing of a subtree (along the axis from the parent to the root of the subtree) might change both the aspect ratio and the angular resolution of the drawing. We show that optimizing the angular resolution as well as the aspect ratio with respect to this type of rooted ordered trees is reducible to the perfect matching problem for bipartite graphs, which is solvable in polynomial time. Aside from studying balloon drawing from an algorithmic viewpoint, we also propose a local magnetic spring model for producing dynamic balloon drawings with applications to the drawings of galaxy systems, H-trees, and sparse graphs, which are of practical interest."
673,On Balloon Drawings of Rooted Trees,"Among various styles of tree drawing reported in the literature, balloon drawing enjoys a desirable feature of displaying tree structures in a rather balanced fashion. Each subtree in the balloon drawing of a tree is enclosed in a circle. Along any path from the root node, the radius of each circle reflects the number of descendants associated with the root node of the subtree. In this paper, we investigate various issues related to balloon drawings of rooted trees from the algorithmic viewpoint. First, we design an efficient algorithm to optimize the angular resolution and the aspect ratio for the balloon drawings of rooted unordered trees. For the case of ordered trees for which the center of the enclosing circle of a subtree need not coincide with the root of the subtree, flipping the drawing of a subtree (along the axis from the parent to the root of the subtree) might change both the aspect ratio and the angular resolution of the drawing. We show that optimizing the angular resolution as well as the aspect ratio with respect to this type of rooted ordered trees is reducible to the perfect matching problem for bipartite graphs, which is solvable in polynomial time. In addition, a related problem concerning the optimization of the drawing area can be modelled as a specific type of nonlinear programming for which there exist several robust algorithms in practice. With a slight modification to the balloon drawing, we are able to generate the drawings of galaxy systems, H-trees, and sparse graphs, which are of practical interest."
674,Balloon Views of Source Code and Their Multiscalable Font Modes,"The majority of program editors available on the market support the view of a directory-explorer style to display only those code lines of interest. Among them, the fisheye and the fractal views of source code (in which each line has a value reflecting the degree of interest and importance) have received a lot of attention in the literature. In information visualization, drawing trees based on fractal theory also plays an interesting role as the so-called balloon drawing of hierarchical data includes two models: the fractal and the SNS (subtrees with nonuniform sizes) models. It is therefore natural to consider a new source code visualization style based on the SNS model of balloon drawing. A main feature of the SNS view is that the value of each line reflects the number of its descendants when the source code is viewed as a tree structure. Unlike the view of a directory-explorer style, the multiscalable font mode (which was originally utilized in the fractal view of source code) displays all the lines in such a way that each line has the font size proportional to its value. In this paper, we investigate various issues concerning the multiscalable font modes of the fish-eye, the fractal, and the SNS views of source code, in hope of providing guidelines for the programmer to better comprehend the program code in practice."
675,Visualizing Phylogenetic Trees by Spring-Embedder Models,"A phylogenetic tree is a graphical representation of the evolutionary relationship between taxonomic groups. The term phylogeny refers to the evolution or historical development of a plant or animal species, or even a human tribe or similar group. In order to make ourself to understand the structure of phylogenetic tree. We present a spring-embedder model for drawing rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees with straight edges. Our heuristic strives for uniform edge lengths, and we develop it in analogy to forces in natural systems, for a simple, elegant, conceptually intuitive, and efficient algorithm. These algorithms are implemented on a web-based phylogeny visualization system that interoperates with existing tools developed for phylogenetic processing including CLUSTAL W, PHYLIP, PAUP. The molecular biologists can also manually construct their phylogenetic tree via existing system in, e.g., the Phylip format produced by CLUSTAL W as input format of the web system to which this data is to be fed."
676,Algorithm for Improving the Aspect Ratio of Treemaps,
677,Complexity analysis of balloon drawing for rooted trees,"In a balloon drawing of a tree, all the children under the same parent are placed on the circumference of the circle centered at their parent, and the radius of the circle centered at each node along any path from the root reflects the number of descendants associated with the node. Among various styles of tree drawings reported in the literature, the balloon drawing enjoys a desirable feature of displaying tree structures in a rather balanced fashion. For each internal node in a balloon drawing, the ray from the node to each of its children divides the wedge accommodating the subtree rooted at the child into two sub-wedges. Depending on whether the two sub-wedge angles are required to be identical or not, a balloon drawing can further be divided into two types: even sub-wedge and uneven sub-wedge types. In the most general case, for any internal node in the tree there are two dimensions of freedom that affect the quality of a balloon drawing: (1) altering the order in which the children of the node appear in the drawing, and (2) for the subtree rooted at each child of the node, flipping the two sub-wedges of the subtree. In this paper, we give a comprehensive complexity analysis for optimizing balloon drawings of rooted trees with respect to angular resolution, aspect ratio and standard deviation of angles under various drawing cases depending on whether the tree is of even or uneven sub-wedge type and whether (1) and (2) above are allowed. It turns out that some are NP-complete while others can be solved in polynomial time. We also derive approximation algorithms for those that are intractable in general."

For each internal node in a balloon drawing, the ray from the node to each of its children divides the wedge accommodating the subtree rooted at the child into two sub-wedges. Depending on whether the two sub-wedge angles are required to be identical or not, a balloon drawing can further be divided into two types: even sub-wedge and uneven sub-wedge types. In the most general case, for any internal node in the tree there are two dimensions of freedom that affect the quality of a balloon drawing: (1) altering the order in which the children of the node appear in the drawing, and (2) for the subtree rooted at each child of the node, flipping the two sub-wedges of the subtree. In this paper, we give a comprehensive complexity analysis for optimizing balloon drawings of rooted trees with respect to angular resolution, aspect ratio and standard deviation of angles under various drawing cases depending on whether the tree is of even or uneven sub-wedge type and whether (1) and (2) above are allowed. It turns out that some are NP-complete while others can be solved in polynomial time. We also derive approximation algorithms for those that are intractable in general."
679,Linked Treemap: A 3D Treemap-nodelink layout for visualizing hierarchical structures,"Hierarchical structures are present in many different areas of our daily life as well as in sciences. Visualization methods are quite commonly applied to support comprehension of the more complex structures. Nodelinks and treemaps are two widely spread directions of such visualization methods. Visualizations using nodelinks have the advantage of explicitly displaying the hierarchical relations between entities. Visualizations using treemaps, on the other hand, allow for a good global understanding of the present entities and some of their properties. We present a visualization tool for hierarchical structures that combines the advantages of treemaps and nodelinks by naturally incorporating them into a 3D layout. The nodelink is built upon the treemap in a direction orthogonal to the treemap plane. Our visualization tool supports various navigation techniques suitable for different analysis tasks. First, the user interaction allows users to render subtrees of the nodelink transparently. Second, the various levels can be explored separately in an intuitive fashion by sliding its plane through the orthogonal nodelink layout and, thus, moving the treemap to the respective level of the hierarchy. Third, zooming into regions of interest is supported by using a focus+context technique that operates on the combined 3D layout. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our system for visual exploration purposes in a case study that uses our system as a file explorer. In this context, we perform a user study that evaluates our approach and allows for a comparison to other existing approaches."
680,The visual funding navigator: Analysis of the NSF funding information,"This paper presents an interactive visualization toolkit for navigating and analyzing the National Science Foundation (NSF) funding information. Our design builds upon an improved 2.5D treemap layout and the stacked graph to contribute customized techniques for visually navigating and interacting with the hierarchical data of NSF programs and proposals. Furthermore, an incremental layout method is adopted to handle information on a large scale. The improved treemap visualization will help to visually analyze the static funding related data and the stacked graph is utilized to analyze the time-series data. Through these visual analysis techniques, research trends of NSF, popular NSF programs are quickly identified."
681,Interactive Visual Analysis of the NSF Funding Information,"This paper presents an interactive visualization toolkit for navigating and analyzing the National Science Foundation (NSF) funding information. Our design builds upon the treemap layout and the stacked graph to contribute customized techniques for visually navigating and interacting with the hierarchical data of NSF programs and proposals, supporting visual search and analysis, and allowing the user to make informed decision. In this visualization toolkit, we propose two visualization techniques to simplify the navigation of the hierarchical data: 2.5 Dimensional treemaps to make the hierarchical structure more easily to be recognized, and labeled treemap to help the user to get a clear overview of the content of the structure and make the internal area of rectangles correspond to the weights of the data set. Furthermore, an incremental layout method is adopted to handle information on a large scale. The improved treemap visualization will help to visually analyze the static funding data and the stacked graph is utilized to analyze the time-series data. Through these visual analysis techniques, research trends of NSF, popular NSF programs are quickly identified. The primary contribution is a demonstration of novel ways to effectively present and analyze NSF funding data."
682,A hierarchical data visualization algorithm: Self-adapting Sunburst algorithm,"Sunburst is a hierarchical data visualization method which is filled by radial sectors, for the problem that sectors of Sunburst are placed in disorder and space utilization rate is low, Self-Adapting Sunburst Algorithm (SASA) has been proposed. Nodes are allocated their areas according to their attribute value, and siblings of same parents are made in ascending order according to the size of areas, adjusting the position of sectors. Meanwhile, based on total number of nodes in each layer, SASA dynamically determines width of this circular ring, following the principle ""more nodes wider circular ring and fewer nodes thinner circular ring"", and in this way, it can optimize the size of nested ring in Sunburst and improve space utilization rate. Finally, User Locating Efficiency (ULE) and Arc Ratio (AR) is put forward to examine SASA, Experimental results show that this algorithm can indeed optimize sector's arrangement, as well as make space utilization better."
683,CoVennTree: A new method for the comparative analysis of large datasets,"The visualization of massive datasets, such as those resulting from comparative metatranscriptome analyses or the analysis of microbial population structures using ribosomal RNA sequences, is a challenging task. We developed a new method called CoVennTree (Comparative weighted Venn Tree) that simultaneously compares up to three multifarious datasets by aggregating and propagating information from the bottom to the top level and produces a graphical output in Cytoscape. With the introduction of weighted Venn structures, the contents and relationships of various datasets can be correlated and simultaneously aggregated without losing information. We demonstrate the suitability of this approach using a dataset of 16S rDNA sequences obtained from microbial populations at three different depths of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea. CoVennTree has been integrated into the Galaxy ToolShed and can be directly downloaded and integrated into the user instance."
684,FanLens: A Visual Toolkit for Dynamically Exploring the Distribution of Hierarchical Attributes,"Radial, space-filling visualization is very useful for representing the distribution of attributes in hierarchical data; however it also suffers from its drawbacks in terms of view transition, context preservation, thin slices, flexibility and large sized data support. To address these problems, we propose FanLens, an enhancement upon existing approaches with new features like incremental layout and fisheye distortion based selecting. This visual toolkit also features dynamic hierarchy specification, dynamic visual property mapping, smooth animation, etc. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique with two examples of case study and results from informal user experiments."
685,Cascaded Treemaps: Examining the Visibility and Stability of Structure in Treemaps,"Treemaps are an important and commonly-used approach to hierarchy visualization, but an important limitation of treemaps is the difficulty of discerning the structure of a hierarchy. This paper presents cascaded treemaps, a new approach to treemap presentation that is based in cascaded rectangles instead of the traditional nested rectangles. Cascading uses less space to present the same containment relationship, and the space savings enable a depth effect and natural padding between siblings in complex hierarchies. In addition, we discuss two general limitations of existing treemap layout algorithms: disparities between node weight and relative node size that are introduced by layout algorithms ignoring the space dedicated to presenting internal nodes, and a lack of stability when generating views of different levels of treemaps as a part of supporting interactive zooming. We finally present a two-stage layout process that addresses both concerns, computing a stable structure for the treemap and then using that structure to consider the presentation of internal nodes when arranging the treemap. All of this work is presented in the context of two large real-world hierarchies, the Java package hierarchy and the eBay auction hierarchy."
686,Constructing a Labeled Treemap with Balanced Layout,"The present invention provides a method and system for constructing a labeled treemap with balanced layout. A range of possible densities of leaf nodes based on designated weights of the leaf nodes and a designated treemap region is determined. A range of possible densities is then searched for a density that could be fitted on and a labeled treemap that could fit on the density. The labeled treemap is presented on a specified display region. By introducing the concept of density into labeled treemap, the present invention ensures the area of region occupied by each leaf node in the constructed labeled treemap is approximately corresponding to the weight of the node, and avoids the case of invisible leaf node in a treemap."
687,Explode to Explain -- Illustrative Information Visualization,"Due to complexity, modern visualization techniques for large data volumes and complex interrelationships are difficult to understand for non-expert users and even for expert users the visualization result may be difficult to interpret. Often the limited screen space and the risk of occlusion hinders a meaningful explanation of techniques or datasets by additional visual elements. This paper presents a novel way how views from information visualization can be adapted by the use of the well-known illustrative technique ""exploded view"", to successfully face the problems described above. The application of exploded views gains screen space for an explanation in a smart way and acts explanatory itself. With our approach of illustrating visual representations, the understanding of complex visualization techniques is eased and new comprehensible views on data are given."
688,Fast detection and display of symmetry in trees,"The automatic construction of good drawings of abstract graphs is a problem of practical importance. Displaying symmetry appears as one of the main criteria for achieving goodness. An expression is obtained for the maximum number of axial symmetries of a tree which can be simultaneously displayed in a single drawing, and an algorithm is presented for constructing such a maximally-symmetric drawing. Similar results are also obtained for rotational symmetries in trees. The algorithms run in time which is linear in the size of the tree, and hence are optimal."
689,Compact layout of layered trees,"The standard layered drawing convention for trees in which the vertical placement of a node is given by its level in the tree and each node is centered between its children can lead to drawings which are quite wide. We present two new drawing conventions which reduce the layout width to be less than some maximum width while still maintaining the essential layered drawing convention. These conventions relax the requirement that a parent must be exactly placed midway between its children, and instead make this a preference which can be violated if this is required for the layout to fit into the required width. Both drawing conventions give rise to a simple kind of quadratic programming problem. We give an iterative gradient projection algorithm for solving this kind of problem, and also a linear time heuristic algorithm. Our algorithms are practical: a tree with three thousand nodes can be laid out in less than a hundred milliseconds with either algorithm."
690,Hi-Trees and Their Layout,"We introduce hi-trees, a new visual representation for hierarchical data in which, depending on the kind of parent node, the child relationship is represented using either containment or links. We give a drawing convention for hi-trees based on the standard layered drawing convention for rooted trees, then show how to extend standard bottom-up tree layout algorithms to draw hi-trees in this convention. We also explore a number of other more compact layout styles for layout of larger hi-trees and give algorithms for computing these. Finally, we describe two applications of hi-trees: argument mapping and business decision support."

693,Fractal representations of Cayley graphs,The visualization of Cayley graphs for many groups is possible using 3-D models. Most of our examples are Cayley graphs of infinite groups where we exploit automatic structures to efficiently produce computer images of the Cayley graphs. The infinite groups are visualized using fractal rescaling so that the infinite graph projects into a bounded domain. Varying the color choice for these fractal representations of the Cayley graphs allows the visual recognition of features such as positivity of the total exponent of the words.
694,Circular drawings of rooted trees,"We describe an algorithm producing circular layouts for trees, that is drawings, where subtrees of a node lie within circles, and these circles are themselves placed on the circumference of a circle. The complexity and methodology of our algorithm compares to Reingold and Tilford's algorithm for trees. Moreover, the algorithm naturally admits distortion transformations of the layout. This, added to its low complexity, makes it very well suited to be used in an interactive environment."
695,Parallel h-v drawings of binary trees,"In this paper we present a method to obtain optimal h-v and inclusion drawings in parallel. Based on parallel tree contraction, our method computes optimal (with respect to a class of cost functions of the enclosing rectangle) drawings in O(log2n) parallel time by using a polynomial number of EREW processors. The method can be extended to compute optimal inclusion layouts in the case where each leaf l of the tree is represented by rectangle l x*l y. Our method also yields an NC algorithm for the slicing floorplanning problem. Whether this problem was in NC was an open question."
696,A note on parallel algorithms for optimal h-v drawings of binary trees,"In this paper we present a method to obtain optimal h-v drawings in parallel. Based on parallel tree contraction, our method computes optimal (with respect to a class of cost functions of the enclosing rectangle) drawings in O(log2n) parallel time by using a polynomial number of EREW processors. The number of processors reduces substantially when we study minimum area drawings. Our work places the problem of obtaining optimal size h-v drawings in NC, presenting the first algorithm with polylogarithmic time complexity."
697,EVEVis: A Multi-Scale Visualization System for Dense Evolutionary Data,"Evolutionary simulations can produce datasets consisting of thousands or millions of separate entities, complete with their genealogical relationships. Biologists must examine this data to determine when and where these entities have changed, both on an individual basis and on a population-wide basis. Therefore, desirable features of a visualization system for evolutionary data are the capability of showing the status of the population at any given moment in time, good scalability, and smooth transition between high-level and low-level views. We propose a multi-scale visualization method, including a novel tree layout that both shows population status over time and can easily scale to very large populations. From this layout, the user can navigate to visualizations for moments in time or for individual entities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the visualization on an existing evolutionary simulation called EVE: Evolution in Variable Environments."
698,An Occlusion-Reduced 3D Hierarchical Data Visualization Technique,"Occlusion is an important problem to be solved for readability improvement of 3D visualization techniques. This paper presents an occlusion reduction technique for cityscape-style 3D visualization techniques. The paper first presents an algorithm for occlusion reduction. It generates bounding boxes of 3D objects on the 2D display space, moves them to reduce their overlap, and finally reversely projects their movements onto the 3D space. The paper then presents an application of the algorithm to our own hierarchical data visualization technique, and a music browser based on the technique. The paper also shows several numerical evaluations that denote the effectiveness of the presented technique."
699,Extension models of Cone Tree Visualizations to Large scale Knowledge base with Semantic Relations,"Cone Tree is an appealing interactive 3D visualization model for hierarchical data structure. In any prior studies, data objects for visualization were constructed by only tree structure, which contained small number of data and nodes. Subject domains in real world for visualization studies have highly complicated relations, which cannot to be expressed in a few nodes and only hierarchical structure. In this paper, we proposed the visualization technique based on cone tree model to apply for a large-scale knowledge base, which has complicated data structure. The EDR Electronic Dictionary as a large-scale knowledge base was used in our study. The visualization system fro EDR was implemented with Java 3D. This paper describes the technique and the implemented system, and discusses some problems on the technique."
700,Drawing dynamic trees,"A tree-drawing algorithm that addresses the weaknesses of current approaches to constructing graphical user interfaces is presented. Present algorithms either do not let you draw tree nodes of varying shapes and sizes or they draw such trees in a way that does not produce trees as compact as they could be, which is especially important when diagramming a large system. Also, they cannot reuse layout information when the trees changes, so after every change the layout must be recomputed and the tree redrawn. The main difference between these traditional approaches and the author's approach is that his algorithm is more geometric. Unlike other algorithms, it uses an explicit representation of node and subtree contours, and it stores every contour as a polygon. It has three advantages over traditional algorithms. It allows one to draw trees with nodes of any polygonal shape compactly. The data structure supports insert and delete operations on subtrees. It is simple to implement, yet flexible."
701,MoireTrees: Visualization and Interaction for Multi-Hierarchical Data,"Visualizing hierarchical data is one of the core areas of information visualization. Most of these techniques focus on single hierarchies - hierarchies with a single root element and a single path to each element. In contrast, this work focuses on the browsing of multi-hierarchies - hierarchies with multiple roots or multiple paths per element. A radial focus+context display algorithm and interaction methods are introduced to explore such multi-hierarchical data. A series of examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our new visualization."
702,Minimum-Layer Drawings of Trees,"A layered drawing of a tree T is a planar straight-line drawing of T, where the vertices of T are placed on some horizontal lines called layers. A minimum-layer drawing of T is a layered drawing of T on k layers, where k is the minimum number of layers required for any layered drawing of T. In this paper we give a linear-time algorithm for obtaining minimum-layer drawings of trees."
703,Visualizing Calling Context profiles with Ring Charts,"Calling context profiling is an important technique for analysing the performance of object-oriented software with complex inter-procedural control flow. A common data structure is the Calling Context Tree (CCT), which stores dynamic metrics, such as CPU time, separately for each calling context. As CCTs may comprise millions of nodes, there is need for a condensed visualization that eases the location of performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce Calling Context Ring Charts, a new compact visualization for CCTs, where callee methods are represented in ring segments surrounding the caller's ring segment. In order to reveal hot methods, their callers, and callees, the ring segments can be sized according to a chosen dynamic metric."
704,Visualizing and exploring profiles with calling context ring charts,"Calling context profiling is an important technique for analyzing the performance of object-oriented software with complex inter-procedural control flow. The Calling Context Tree (CCT) is a common data structure that stores dynamic metrics, such as CPU time, separately for each calling context. As CCTs may comprise millions of nodes, there is a need for a condensed visualization that eases the localization of performance bottlenecks. In this article, we discuss Calling Context Ring Charts (CCRCs), a compact visualization for CCTs, where callee methods are represented in ring segments surrounding the caller's ring segment. In order to reveal hot methods, their callers, and callees, the ring segments can be sized according to a chosen dynamic metric. We describe two case studies where CCRCs help us to detect and fix performance problems in applications. A performance evaluation also confirms that our implementation can efficiently handle large CCTs."
705,H3: laying out large directed graphs in 3D hyperbolic space,"We present the H3 layout technique for drawing large directed graphs as node-link diagrams in 3D hyperbolic space. We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees."
706,Exploring large graphs in 3D hyperbolic space,"Drawing graphs as nodes connected by links is visually compelling but computationally difficult. Hyperbolic space and spanning trees can reduce visual clutter, speed up layout, and provide fluid interaction. This article briefly describes a software system that explicitly attempts to handle much larger graphs than previous systems and support dynamic exploration rather than final presentation. It then discusses the applicability of this system to goals beyond simple exploration. A software system that supports graph exploration should include both a layout and an interactive drawing component. I have developed new algorithms for both layout and drawing (H3 and H3Viewer). The H3Viewer drawing algorithm remains under development, so this article presents preliminary results. I have implemented a software library that uses these algorithms. It can handle graphs of more than 100,000 edges by using a spanning tree as the backbone for the layout and drawing algorithms."
707,Drawing Large Graphs with H3Viewer and Site Manager,"We demonstrate the H3Viewer graph drawing library, which can be run from a standalone program or in conjunction with other programs such as SGI's Site Manager application. Our layout and drawing algorithms support interactive navigation of large graphs up to 100,000 edges. We present an adaptive drawing algorithm with a guaranteed frame rate. Both layout and navigation occur in 3D hyperbolic space, which provides a view of a large neighborhood around an easily changeable point of interest. We find an appropriate spanning tree to use as the backbone for fast layout and uncluttered drawing, and non-tree links can be displayed on demand. Our methods are appropriate when node or link annotations can guide the choice of a good parent from among all of the incoming links. Such annotations can be constructed using only a small amount of domain-specific knowledge, thus rendering tractable many graphs which may seem rather densely connected at first glance."
708,Interactive visualization of large graphs and networks,"Many real-world domains can be represented as large node-link graphs: backbone Internet routers connect with 70,000 other hosts, mid-sized Web servers handle between 20,000 and 200,000 hyperlinked documents, and dictionaries contain millions of words defined in terms of each other. Computational manipulation of such large graphs is common, but previous tools for graph visualization have been limited to datasets of a few thousand nodes. Visual depictions of graphs and networks are external representations that exploit human visual processing to reduce the cognitive load of many tasks that require understanding of global or local structure. We assert that the two key advantages of computer-based systems for information visualization over traditional paper-based visual exposition are interactivity and scalability. We also argue that designing visualization software by taking the characteristics of a target user's task domain into account leads to systems that are more effective and scale to larger datasets than previous work. This thesis contains a detailed analysis of three specialized systems for the interactive exploration of large graphs, relating the intended tasks to the spatial layout and visual encoding choices. We present two novel algorithms for specialized layout and drawing that use quite different visual metaphors. The H3 system for visualizing the hyperlink structures of web sites scales to datasets of over 100,000 nodes by using a carefully chosen spanning tree as the layout backbone, 3D hyperbolic geometry for a Focus+Context view, and provides a fluid interactive experience through guaranteed frame rate drawing. The Constellation system features a highly specialized 2D layout intended to spatially encode domain-specific information for computational linguists checking the plausibility of a large semantic network created from dictionaries. The Planet Multicast system for displaying the tunnel topology of the Internet's multicast backbone provides a literal 3D geographic layout of arcs on a globe to help MBone maintainers find misconfigured long-distance tunnels. Each of these three systems provides a very different view of the graph structure, and we evaluate their efficacy for the intended task. We generalize these findings in our analysis of the importance of interactivity and specialization for graph visualization systems that are effective and scalable."
709,TreeJuxtaposer: Scalable tree comparison using Focus+Context with guaranteed visibility,"Structural comparison of large trees is a difficult task that is only partially supported by current visualization techniques, which are mainly designed for browsing. We present TreeJuxtaposer, a system designed to support the comparison task for large trees of several hundred thousand nodes. We introduce the idea of ""guaranteed visibility"", where highlighted areas are treated as landmarks that must remain visually apparent at all times. We propose a new methodology for detailed structural comparison between two trees and provide a new nearly-linear algorithm for computing the best corresponding node from one tree to another. In addition, we present a new rectilinear Focus+Context technique for navigation that is well suited to the dynamic linking of side-by-side views while guaranteeing landmark visibility and constant frame rates. These three contributions result in a system delivering a fluid exploration experience that scales both in the size of the dataset and the number of pixels in the display. We have based the design decisions for our system on the needs of a target audience of biologists who must understand the structural details of many phylogenetic, or evolutionary, trees. Our tool is also useful in many other application domains where tree comparison is needed, ranging from network management to call graph optimization to genealogy."
710,Visualizing large trees and graphs using a 3D cone tree layout,"Tree and graph structures are often visualized as 2D linear tree diagrams with labeled dots and connecting lines. But when the data grows beyond several dozen nodes, these diagrams become large and awkward. This article looks at a 3D Cone Tree scheme for visualizing trees and graphs with several thousand nodes. I outline the layout algorithm, show examples, and discuss strengths and weaknesses for the approach."
711,PhylloTrees: Phyllotactic Patterns for Tree Layout,"Motivations for drawing hierarchical structures are probably as diverse as datasets to visualize. This ubiquity of tree structures has lead to a manifold of tree layout algorithms and tree visualization systems. While many tree layouts exist, increasingly massive data sets, expanding computational power, and still relatively limited display space make tree layout algorithms a topic of ongoing interest. We explore the use of nature's phyllotactic patterns to inform the layout of hierarchical data. These naturally occurring patterns provide a non-overlapping, optimal packing when the total number of nodes is not known a priori. We present PhylloTrees, a family of expandable tree layouts based on these patterns."
712,Method and apparatus for the viewing and exploration of the content of hierarchical information,"A method for the conversion and display of tree-structured information to a ""treetable"", a table-like display structure, in which each path from a root to a leaf node is represented by a single column, and cells representing the immediate successors of a node are placed immediately under that node. Variation in the amount of space given to cells within particular columns is used to allow more detail to be given for selected paths and subtrees. Extraction of subparts of a treetable into another such structure is used for deeper exploration of trees. The treetable structure is also suitable for use as a selector and guide to the reading, in auxiliary displays, of the concatenated node content associated with either (a) individual columns (representing full paths), or (b) all successors to a given node."
713,Method and apparatus for the construction and use of table-like visualizations of hierarchic material,"A method for the conversion and display of tree-structured information to a ""treetable"", a table-like display structure, in which each path from a root to a leaf node is represented by a single column, and cells representing the immediate successors of a node are placed immediately under that node. Variation in the amount of space given to cells within particular columns is used to allow more detail to be given for selected paths and subtrees.

The treatable structure is also suitable for use as a selector and guide to the reading, in auxiliary displays, of the concatenated node content associated with either (a) individual columns (representing full paths), or (b) all successors to a given node."
714,A visualization tool for interactive learning of large decision trees,"Decision tree induction is certainly among the most applicable learning techniques due to its power and simplicity. However learning decision trees from large datasets, particularly in data mining, is quite different from learning from small or moderately sized datasets. When learning from large datasets, decision tree induction programs often produce very large trees. How to efficiently visualize trees in the learning process, particularly large trees, is still questionable and currently requires efficient tools. The paper presents a visualization tool for interactive learning of large decision trees, that includes a new visualization technique called T2.5D (Trees 2.5 Dimensions). After a brief discussion on requirements for tree visualizers and related work, the paper focuses on presenting developing techniques for two issues: (1) how to visualize efficiently large decision trees; and (2) how to visualize decision trees in the learning process"
715,A Space-Optimized Tree Visualization,"We describe a new method for the visualization of tree structured relational data. It can be used especially for the display of very large hierarchies in a 2-dimensional space. We discuss the advantages and limitations of current techniques of tree visualization. Our strategy is to optimize the drawing of trees in a geometrical plane and maximize the utilization of display space by allowing more nodes and links to be displayed at a limit screen resolution. We use the concept of enclosure to partition the entire display space into a collection of local regions that are assigned to all nodes in tree T for the display of their sub-trees and themselves. To enable the exploration of large hierarchies, we use a modified semantic zooming technique to view the detail of a particular part of the hierarchy at a time based on user's interest. Layout animation is also provided to preserve the mental map while the user is exploring the hierarchy by changing zoomed views."
716,Improvements of Space-Optimized Tree for Visualizing and Manipulating Very Large Hierarchies,This paper describes some improvements over the original Space-Optimized Tree technique for the visualization and manipulation of very large hierarchies. The new system uses an improved algorithm to calculate geometrical layouts and it also provides better navigation capability. We introduce our new layout algorithm that can make more consistence of the display than the original layout technique made. We also combine DualView (a new focus+context technique) with the current modified semantic zooming in order to interactively navigate through the large and very large hierarchies.
717,Space-optimized tree: A connection+enclosure approach for the visualization of large hierarchies,"This paper describes a new approach, space-optimized tree, for the visualization and navigation of tree-structured relational data. This technique can be used especially for the display of very large hierarchies in a two-dimensional space. We discuss the advantages and limitations of current techniques of tree visualization. Our strategy is to optimize the drawing of trees in a geometrical plane and maximize the utilization of display space by allowing more nodes and links to be displayed at a limited screen resolution. Space-optimized tree is a connection+enclosure visualization approach that recursively positions children of a subtree into polygon areas and still uses a node-link diagram to present the entire hierarchical structure. To be able to handle the navigation of large hierarchies, we use a new hybrid viewing technique that combines two viewing methods, the modified semantic zooming and a focus+context technique. While the semantic zooming technique can enlarge a particular viewing area by filtering out the rest of tree structure from the visualization, the focus+context technique allows the user to interactively focus, view and browse the entire visual structure with a reasonable high-density display."
718,Hierarchical Information Visualization using ENCCON Model,"This paper describes a new efficient approach for visualizing large hierarchical information. Our technique is based on the connection + enclosure visualization model from which the area division is used for the recursive positioning of nodes, while a node-link diagram is still drawn to present the entire hierarchical structure. We inherit the advantages of Space-Optimized (SO) Tree technique that can enhance the usability of display space by using area division. However, we replace a set of polygons used in SO Tree by a set of rectangles for the area division. This not only decreases the computation cost in calculating geometrical polygons, but also greatly reduces the human perceptual and cognitive loads spent on understanding the underlying hierarchical structure. We use semantic zooming technique to enlarge a particular viewing area and filter out the rest of structure that is less interested. The navigation is accommodated by animation in order to preserve the mental map."
719,Visualising file-systems using ENCCON model,"This paper describes a new approach for visualising the file structures. Our technique uses an <u>enc</u>losure + <u>con</u>nection (ENCCON) approach that provides an overall view of the entire file/directory hierarchy that gives a better understanding of the folder-folder and folder-file relationships, and therefore makes easier for the navigation. We firstly use the rectangular regions to present the folders. This allows the user to immediately percept the location, size (number of files contained) and other properties of any particular folder. To enrich the visual attributes of the file structure, we also use a node-link diagram to present the ""belonging"" relationships. This ""belonging"" relationship includes folder-folder and folder-file relationships. We use a semantic zooming technique to enlarge the display of files and folders in a particular focused area. The animation is also accommodated in order to preserve the mental map [Bartram 1997] during the navigation."
720,EncCon: An approach to constructing interactive visualization of large hierarchical data,"This paper describes a new technique called EncCon for visualizing and navigating large hierarchical information. This technique consists of two components: visualization and navigation. Visualization uses a fast enclosure+connection method to calculate the geometrical layout for the display of large hierarchies in a two-dimensional space. Our technique uses a rectangular division algorithm for recursively positioning the graph. This visualization aims to maximize the utilization of display space while retaining a good geometrical layout as well as a clear (explicit) presentation of the hierarchical structure of graphs. This paper also presents an experimental evaluation of EncCon's layout algorithm. Besides the layout algorithm, EncCon uses a new focus+context viewing technique for the navigation of large hierarchies. We use the zooming+layering concept to achieve the focus+context viewing, rather than the traditional enlarge+embedded concept, which is used by most of the available focus+context techniques. Technically, it employs semi-transparency to achieve the display of two layers of information in z-coordination at the same visualization. Both context view and detail view are drawn at two separate layers. These layers are then displayed in an overlapped manner at the same physical screen space."
721,Using visual cues on DOITree for visualizing large hierarchical data,"This paper extends a previous work on node link tree visualization and interaction by providing visual clues on hidden structures. We adopt the effectiveness of DOI Tree, a multi-focal tree layout algorithm, for exploring large hierarchical structures. The advantages of visualization are its most familiar mapping for users, its capability on providing multiple focused nodes, and its dynamic rescaling of substructures to fit the available space. By providing various methods of topological previews of substructure including simple icon view, tree view and tree map view, we provide better understanding the topology of hidden branches."
722,"Computing Voronoi Treemaps: Faster, Simpler, and Resolution-independent","Voronoi treemaps represent hierarchies as nested polygons. We here show that, contrary to the apparent popular belief, utilization of an algorithm for weighted Voronoi diagrams is not only feasible, but also more efficient than previous low-resolution approximations, even when the latter are implemented on graphics hardware. More precisely, we propose an instantiation of Lloyd's method for centroidal Voronoi diagrams with Aurenhammer's algorithm for power diagrams that yields an algorithm running in O(n*logn) rather than Omega(n*n) time per iteration, with n the number of sites. We describe its implementation and present evidence that it is faster also in practice."
723,Exploring the PieTree for Representing Numerical Hierarchical Data,This paper describes the first full implementation and evaluation of an area-based tree visualization known as the PieTree. The PieTree was first proposed in papers in 1998 and 2000 but has never been fully implemented and evaluated. Informal evaluation was used to enhance the usability of the PieTree and compare it with the more well-known TreeMap. A controlled experiment considered parallel views' effect on task performance time. There were substantial differences between kinds of tasks and in participants' styles of use. Whilst suggesting that further development of PieTrees is worthwhile the experiments underline the importance of careful task fit.
724,Circular Partitions with Applications to Visualization and Embeddings,"We introduce a hierarchical partitioning scheme of the Euclidean plane, called circular partitions. Such a partition consists of a hierarchy of convex polygons, each having small aspect ratio, and satisfying specified volume constraints. We apply these partitions to obtain a natural extension of the popular Treemap visualization method. Our proposed algorithm is not constrained in using only rectangles, and can achieve provably better guarantees on the aspect ratio of the constructed polygons. Under relaxed conditions, we can also construct circular partitions in higher-dimensional spaces. We use these relaxed partitions to obtain improved approximation algorithms for embedding ultrametrics into d-dimensional Euclidean space. In particular, we give a polylog(Delta)-approximation algorithm for embedding n-point ultrametrics into R^d with minimum distortion (Delta denotes the spread of the metric). The previously best-known approximation ratio for this problem was polynomial in n. This is the first algorithm for embedding a non-trivial family of weighted graph metrics into a space of constant dimension that achieves polylogarithmic approximation ratio."
725,Visualizing Hierarchies and Collection Structures with Fractal Trees,"This paper addresses the need for better information access to digital library collections. Without proper visualization tools, organizational and structural information is often lost or suppressed by digital library interfaces. We discuss a 2D fractal tree visualization tool that can be used to more accurately present the structure, organization and interrelation of collection metadata."
726,Embeddings of complete binary trees into grids and extended grids with total vertex-congestion 1,"Let G and H be two simple, undirected graphs. An embedding of the graph G into the graph H is an injective mapping f from the vertices of G to the vertices of H, together with a mapping which assigns to each edge [u,v] of G a path between f(u) and f(v) in H. The grid M(r,s) is the graph whose vertex set is the set of pairs on nonnegative integers, (i,j): 0<=i<r, 0<=j<s, in which there is an edge between vertices (i,j) and (k,l) if either |i-k|=1 and j=l or i=k and |j-l|=1. The extended grid EM(r,s) is the graph whose vertex set is the set of pairs on nonnegative integers, (i,j): 0<=i<r, 0<=j<s, in which there is an edge between vertices (i,j) and (k,l) if and only if |i-k|<=1 and |j-l|<=1. In this paper, we give embeddings of complete binary trees into square grids and extended grids with total vertex-congestion 1, i.e., for any vertex x of the extended grid we have load(x)+vertex-congestion(x)<=1. Depending on the parity of the height of the tree, the expansion of these embeddings is approaching 1.606 or 1.51 for grids, and 1.208 or 1.247 for extended grids."

728,Visualizing the activity of a web-based collaborative platform,"This paper describes a prototype that offers visualization features for monitoring a Web-based collaborative platform. The data displayed supports workplace awareness by providing an overview of the activities carried out on the platform. The prototype focuses on the information structured as hierarchical data. Three views are included: a classic vertical tree, a treemap view and an original new layout called ellimap. The system has been implemented on a real case in the domain of the support to innovation."
729,Innovative Visualization Tools to Monitor Scientific Cooperative Activities,"This paper describes how information visualization techniques can be used to monitor a web-based collaborative platform and to support workplace awareness by providing a global overview of the activities. An innovative prototype is described. Its originality relies on using some enclosure-based visualization methods in the context of activities monitoring, which is rather unusual. In addition, a new layout is described for representing data trees. The use of the system is illustrated with the case of a EU-funded Network of Excellence."
730,CGD -- A New Algorithm to Optimize Space Occupation in Ellimaps,"How to visualize datasets hierarchically structured is a basic issue in information visualization. Compared to the common diagrams based on the nodes-links paradigm (e.g. trees), the enclosure-based methods have shown high potential to represent simultaneously the structure of the hierarchy and the weight of nodes. In addition, these methods often support scalability up to sizes where trees become very complicated to understand. Several approaches belong to this class of visualization methods such as treemaps, ellimaps, circular treemaps or Voronoi treemaps. This paper focuses on the specific case of ellimaps in which the nodes are represented by ellipses nested one into each other. A controlled experiment has previously shown that the initial version of the ellimaps was efficient to support the perception of the dataset structure and was reasonably acceptable for the perception of the node weights. However it suffers from a major drawback in terms of display space occupation. We have tackled this issue and the paper proposes a new algorithm to draw ellimaps. It is based on successive distortions and relocations of the ellipses in order to occupy a larger proportion of the display space than the initial algorithm. A Monte-Carlo simulation has been used to evaluate the filling ratio of the display space in this new approach. The results show a significant improvement of this factor."
731,Improved Similarity Trees and their Application to Visual Data Classification,"An alternative form to multidimensional projections for the visual analysis of data represented in multidimensional spaces is the deployment of similarity trees, such as Neighbor Joining trees. They organize data objects on the visual plane emphasizing their levels of similarity with high capability of detecting and separating groups and subgroups of objects. Besides this similarity-based hierarchical data organization, some of their advantages include the ability to decrease point clutter; high precision; and a consistent view of the data set during focusing, offering a very intuitive way to view the general structure of the data set as well as to drill down to groups and subgroups of interest. Disadvantages of similarity trees based on neighbor joining strategies include their computational cost and the presence of virtual nodes that utilize too much of the visual space. This paper presents a highly improved version of the similarity tree technique. The improvements in the technique are given by two procedures. The first is a strategy that replaces virtual nodes by promoting real leaf nodes to their place, saving large portions of space in the display and maintaining the expressiveness and precision of the technique. The second improvement is an implementation that significantly accelerates the algorithm, impacting its use for larger data sets. We also illustrate the applicability of the technique in visual data mining, showing its advantages to support visual classification of data sets, with special attention to the case of image classification. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tree for analysis and iterative manipulation and employ those capabilities to support evolving to a satisfactory data organization and classification."
732,Quantitative visualizations of hierarchically organized data in a geographic context,"Here we introduce a novel quantitative technique for visualizing hierarchically organized data in a geographic context. In contrast to existing techniques, our visualization emphasizes the hierarchical relationships in the data by depicting them in a standard tree format that takes advantage of many fundamental perceptual properties. Our technique allows users to define a geographic axis and visualize how well a tree correlates with the ordering of geographical locations along this axis. This is accomplished by finding the ordering of leaf nodes, subject to the constraints of the tree topology, which minimizes the number of crossings that occur between lines that connect leaf nodes to their associated geographic locations. In this optimal layout, any crossings that occur between these lines indicate discordance between the topology of the tree and the user defined geographic axis. We have developed a branch-and-bound algorithm that allows optimal leaf orderings to be determined quickly enough to support interactive exploration of different geographic axes even for large multifurcating hierarchies. The quantitative nature of our visualization has allowed us to specify a permutation test for determining if the relationship between a tree topology and a geographic axis is statistically significant. In this paper, the utility of our visualization is demonstrated on biological data sets, but our method is applicable to any hierarchical data where geographic structure may be of interest."
733,GenGIS: A geospatial information system for genomic data,"The increasing availability of genetic sequence data associated with explicit geographic and ecological information is offering new opportunities to study the processes that shape biodiversity. The generation and testing of hypotheses using these data sets requires effective tools for mathematical and visual analysis that can integrate digital maps, ecological data, and large genetic, genomic, or metagenomic data sets. GenGIS is a free and open-source software package that supports the integration of digital map data with genetic sequences and environmental information from multiple sample sites. Essential bioinformatic and statistical tools are integrated into the software, allowing the user a wide range of analysis options for their sequence data. Data visualizations are combined with the cartographic display to yield a clear view of the relationship between geography and genomic diversity, with a particular focus on the hierarchical clustering of sites based on their similarity or phylogenetic proximity. Here we outline the features of GenGIS and demonstrate its application to georeferenced microbial metagenomic, HIV-1, and human mitochondrial DNA data sets."
734,Tracking the evolution and geographic spread of Influenza A,"The 2009 swine-origin strain of Influenza A H1N1 has spread to nearly all parts of the world, with 175 countries reporting confirmed cases thus far. Consistent with seasonal flu outbreaks, the current pandemic strain has shown rapid dispersal, with multiple examples of introduction into different geographic regions. Here we use an automated pipeline to collect data for analysis in the geospatial package GenGIS, which allows the geographic and temporal tracking of new sequence types and polymorphisms. Using this approach, we examine a pair of amino acid changes in the neuraminidase protein that are implicated in antibody recognition, and exhibit global dispersal with little or no geographic structure."
735,Visualizing Web Ontologies with CropCircles,"We apply a new visualization for complex heirarchies, CropCircles, to the interactive visualization ofWeb Ontologies and E-Connections of Web Ontologies."
736,A parent-centered radial layout algorithm for interactive graph visualization and animation,"We have developed (1) a graph visualization system that allows users to explore graphs by viewing them as a succession of spanning trees selected interactively, (2) a radial graph layout algorithm, and (3) an animation algorithm that generates meaningful visualizations and smooth transitions between graphs while minimizing edge crossings during transitions and in static layouts. Our system is similar to the radial layout system of Yee et al. (2001), but differs primarily in that each node is positioned on a coordinate system centered on its own parent rather than on a single coordinate system for all nodes. Our system is thus easy to define recursively and lends itself to parallelization. It also guarantees that layouts have many nice properties, such as: it guarantees certain edges never cross during an animation. We compared the layouts and transitions produced by our algorithms to those produced by Yee et al. Results from several experiments indicate that our system produces fewer edge crossings during transitions between graph drawings, and that the transitions more often involve changes in local scaling rather than structure. These findings suggest the system has promise as an interactive graph exploration tool in a variety of settings."
737,On the approximability of two tree drawing conventions,"We consider two aesthetic criteria for the visualization of rooted trees: inclusion and tip-over. Finding the minimum area layout according to either of these two standards is an NP-hard task, even when we restrict ourselves to binary trees. We provide a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for this problem. This result applies to any tree for tip-over layouts and to bounded degree trees in the case of the inclusion convention. We also prove that such restriction is necessary since, for unbounded degree trees, the inclusion problem is strongly NP-hard. Hence, neither a fully polynomial time approximation scheme nor a pseudopolynomial time algorithm exists, unless P=NP. Our technique, combined with the parallel algorithm by Metaxas et al., also yields an NC fully parallel approximation scheme. This latter result holds for inclusion of binary trees and for the slicing floorplanning problem. Although this problem is in P, it is unknown whether it belongs to NC or not. All the above results also apply to other size functions of the drawing (e.g., the perimeter)."
738,"SpaceTree: Supporting Exploration in Large Node Link Tree, Design Evolution and Empirical Evaluation","We present a novel tree browser that builds on the conventional node link tree diagrams. It adds dynamic rescaling of branches of the tree to best fit the available screen space, optimized camera movement, and the use of preview icons summarizing the topology of the branches that cannot be expanded. In addition, it includes integrated search and filter functions. This paper reflects on the evolution of the design and highlights the principles that emerged from it. A controlled experiment showed benefits for navigation to already previously visited nodes and estimation of overall tree topology."
739,Drawing non-layered tidy trees in linear time,"The well-known Reingoldā€“Tilford algorithm produces tidy-layered drawings of trees: drawings where all nodes at the same depth are vertically aligned. However, when nodes have varying heights, layered drawing may use more vertical space than necessary. A non-layered drawing of a tree places children at a fixed distance from the parent, thereby giving a more vertically compact drawing. Moreover, non-layered drawings can also be used to draw trees where the vertical position of each node is given, by adding dummy nodes. In this paper, we present the first linear-time algorithm for producing non-layered drawings. Our algorithm is a modification of the Reingoldā€“Tilford algorithm, but the original complexity proof of the Reingoldā€“Tilford algorithm uses an invariant that does not hold for the non-layered case. We give an alternative proof of the algorithm and its extension to non-layered drawings. To improve drawings of trees of unbounded degree, extensions to the Reingoldā€“Tilford algorithm have been proposed. These extensions also work in the non-layered case, but we show that they then cause a $O(n^2)$ run-time. We then propose a modification to these extensions that restores the $O(n)$ run-time."
740,Inclusion Tree Layout Convention: An Empirical Investigation,"The inclusion tree layout convention involves drawing trees as nested rectangles rather than the more common node-link diagrams. Finding good inclusion layouts presents some unique challenges, for example, the quantification of what is meant by the ""size"" of a rectangle. This paper empirically evaluates and investigates several rectangle size measures for their usefulness in the inclusion tree layout convention. We find that the area size measure, commonly used in graph drawing, is very poorly suited to the inclusion layout convention, whilst size measures based on the aspect ratio of the layout are more appropriate and give better results."
741,Smooth Structural Zooming of h-v Inclusion Tree Layouts,"We present a new paradigm for achieving focus+context visualizations called smooth structural zooming, which varies the level of detail of the data in different areas of the visualization, as opposed to geometrically distorting the visualization or employing rapid zooming techniques. A smooth structural zooming technique for horizontal-vertical (h-v) inclusion tree layouts is described and applied to the domain of the software design process, specifically, design behaviour trees (DBTs). This system has the ability to navigate and explore data too large to be fully displayed, whilst maintaining an approximately constant level of visual complexity, good visualization aesthetics and preservation of the user's mental map through animation. The technique may be readily extended to arbitrary layout styles and algorithms, and to other hierarchical data structures and relational information, such as clustered graphs."
742,Smooth Structural Zooming as a Tool for Navigating Large Inclusion Hierarchies,"We present a new method for achieving Focus+Context visualizations called smooth structural zooming, which varies the level of detail of the data being visualized, rather than geometrically distorting the visualization. We apply a preliminary smooth structural zooming technique to the horizontal-vertical (h-v) inclusion tree layout convention, in particular Design Behaviour Trees (DBTs). We illustrate several advantages of this system, including the ability to navigate and explore inclusion tree layout data too large to be displayed at once, keeping good layouts at all times and preserving the user's mental map with animation."
743,3D family tree visualization using Rhizome Navigation,"For an upcoming documentary by Benedikt Bjarnason, Rhizome Navigation was used to create animated visualizations of large genealogy data sets. The graph layout was done using an adapted force-directed algorithm and features more than 3300 persons. What set's it apart from similar visualizations is the capability to show far more complex relationships by breaking up the classic tree structure and following a more rhizome-like approach - and of course the sheer amount of relationships shown."
744,Tidier Drawings of Trees,"Various algorithms have been proposed for producing tidy drawings of trees - drawings that are aesthetically pleasing and use minimum drawing space. We show that these algorithms contain some difficulties that lead to aesthetically unpleasing, wider than necessary drawings. We then present a new algorithm with comparable time and storage requirements that produces tidier drawings. Generalizations to forests and m-ary trees are discussed, as are some problems in discretization when alphanumeric output devices are used."
745,The information cube: Using transparency in 3D information visualization,"In this paper, we propose a new 3D visualization technique for hierarchical information. This technique is based on the nested box metaphor, a familiar concept for any users. By using semi-transparent rendering, the system controls the complexity of the information presented to the user. With several 3D interaction techniques provided by the system, the user can recognize and inspect the information structure intuitively. Normally, the user puts on the VR equipment to use the system, but the system is also accessible through a conventional CRT display."
746,Cone Trees: Animated 3D visualizations of hierarchical information,"The task of managing and accessing large information spaces is a problem in large scale cognition. Emerging technologies for 3D visualization and interactive animation offer potential solutions to this problem, especially when the structure of the information can be visualized. We describe one of these Information Visualization techniques, called the Cone Tree, which is used for visualizing hierarchical information structures. The hierarchy is presented in 3D to maximize effective use of available screen space and enable visualization of the whole structure. Interactive animation is used to shift some of the user's cognitive load to the human perceptual system."
747,Display of hierarchical three-dimensional structures with rotating substructures,"A processor presents a sequence of images of a hierarchical structure that is perceived as three-dimensional. The hierarchical structure includes conic substructures that can have vertical or horizontal axes. Each cone has a parent node at its vertex and children nodes along its base, each with a link to the parent node. Each child can in turn be at the vertex of another cone. The cones can be rotated in steps that produce the perception of object constancy for each node. For example, if the user requests that an indicated node be moved to a primary viewing position, each of the cones along the path from the indicated node to the root node is rotated in the direction that most directly moves the indicated node to the primary viewing position. Each node can include a selectable unit for indicating it, and a node can also include a grow tab that can be selected to request presentation of its children nodes and links to them. The user can request that the children nodes of a node be replaced by a grow tab. To reduce the computation necessary for each step of rotation, the position relative to a cone's axis for each of 80 points on the base of a cone is computed for a level of the hierarchy and is then stored in an array for subsequent use in positioning nodes on that level. The base point of each node on a rotating cone can then be changed in a linked node data structure, and its new position can then be obtained by simple arithmetic operations using the axis coordinates and the appropriate data from the array. The base of each array can be a polygon whose vertices are nodes, and the base shape can be presented as a shadow to provide additional information and strengthen the perception of three dimensions. Or, the profiles of the cones can be presented as a shadow."
748,OneZoom: A Fractal Explorer for the Tree of Life,"Our knowledge of the tree of life -- a phylogenetic tree summarizing the evolutionary relationships among all life on Earth -- is expanding rapidly. ""Mega-trees"" with millions of tips (species) are expected to appear imminently. Unfortunately, there has so far been no practical and intuitive way to explore even the much smaller trees with thousands of tips that are now being routinely produced. Without a way to view megatrees, these wondrous objects, representing the culmination of decades of scientific effort, cannot be fully appreciated. The field really needs a solution to this problem to enable scientists to communicate important evolutionary concepts and data effectively, both to each other and to the general public. In this manuscript, we introduce a new approach that solves the problem. Trees with millions of tips, richly embellished with additional data, can now be easily explored within the web browser of any modern hardware with a zooming user interface similar to that used in Google Maps."
749,A new approach to visualizing general trees using thickness-adjustable quadratic curves,"We present a new algorithm for visualization of trees. This algorithm illustrates the hierarchical data by using curve segments for each edge and how edges evolve on a path from the root to the leaves. More clearly, we visualize a tree based on the shape of a botanical tree. The software tool GraphTea implements this algorithm where the adjustable thicknesses of the curve segments reflect the expansion of botanical trees. Here, we consider a simple expansion definition for each vertex as the sum over the number of children and the children of its children up to the some specific level."
750,Real-time interactive visualization of information hierarchies,"An information hierarchy is a collection of relational information that is arranged in a ranking organization where each entity is subject to a single other entity, except for the top (root) element. The usefulness of a visualization of an information hierarchy depends on its capability of conveying the information quickly and clearly. The interaction with the information hierarchy allows a user to further analyze its underlying structures and relationships, which is essential for the effectiveness of the visualization. In this paper we present a novel method to interactively visualize information hierarchies in real-time. We use the World Wide Web as an application example of our techniques. The result is a novel Web browsing and visualization method with an innovative combination of features: (i) Web data is retrieved and displayed in real-time (i.e. Web data is not pre-recorded), (ii) browsing and visualization are synchronized together in the same interface, (iii) tree-based visualization engine, and (iv) space-efficient display of visualization. Our study shows that users are able to orient themselves better in cyberspace and locate Web pages of interest faster."
751,A Practical Algorithm for Planar Straight-line Grid Drawings of General Trees with Linear Area and Arbitrary Aspect Ratio,"Trees are usually drawn using planar straight-line drawings. [2] presented an algorithm for constructing a planar straight-line grid drawing of a degree-d (general) tree with area O(n) and any pre-specified aspect ratio in the range [n^-alpha,n^alpha], where 0 <= alpha <= 1 is any constant, in O(n log n) time. Unfortunately, the algorithm of [2] is not suitable for practical use. The main problem is that the constant hidden in the ""Oh "" notation for area is quite large (for binary trees was 3900). In this paper, we have made several improvements to the algorithm, which make it suitable for practical use. We have also conducted an experiment on this newer version of the algorithm for randomly-generated general trees with up to 50,000 nodes. Our experiment shows that it constructs area-efficient drawings in practice, with area at most 19 times the number of nodes."
752,A Planar Straight-line Grid Drawing Algorithm for High Degree General Trees with User-Specified Angular Coefficient,"General trees are usually displayed as planar straight-line grid drawings which provide an easily understandable structure to the viewer. Current general tree drawing algorithms have one common problem: their drawings on high degree trees produce many small angles, which makes it difficult to distinguish edges. The algorithm we propose in this paper allows the user to provide an angular coefficient and then employs the 'best-effort-delivery' to draw edges such that the angles are above the angular coefficient. It allows the non-root nodes to place their children within a maximum of three quads of the Cartesian plane. When a node has too many children, resulting in an impossibility of achieving angles above the specified angular coefficient, our algorithm distributes all remaining children evenly among the three quads."
753,Information visualization system,"A Web browsing and visualization system and method wherein: (i) Web data is retrieved and displayed in real-time (i.e., Web data is not pre-recorded), (ii) browsing and visualization are synchronized together in the same interface, (iii) a tree-based, rings-type visualization engine, (iv) space-efficient display of visualization, and (v) the amount of resources needed from the host computer is comparatively modest. In addition, the tree-based rings engine used to create the visualization displays the information in a smaller area than previous systems. Thus, the system requires less screen space to display the same amount of information as comparable systems. Alternatively, it can display more information to the user in the same amount of screen space as comparable systems. Moreover, although the present invention is disclosed herein in connection with visualizing Web data, it can be applied to portray any information hierarchy."
754,Flexible Trees: Sketching tree layouts,"We introduce Flexible Trees, a sketch-based layout adjustment technique. Although numerous tree layout algorithms exist, these algorithms are usually bound to fit within standard shapes such as rectangles, circles and triangles. In order to provide the possibility of interactively customizing a tree layout, we offer a free-form sketch-based interaction through which one can re-define the boundary constraints for the tree layouts by combining ray-line intersection and line segment intersection. Flexible Trees offer topology preserving adjustments; can be used with a variety of tree layouts; and offer a simple way of authoring tree layouts for infographic purposes."
755,ContactTress: Ego-centeres visualization of social relations,"A topic of interest in social science research is the study of people's social contacts and activities, in which network visualization is often used to show relations among people and activities. However, network visualization is not ideal for studying individuals and comparing their social behavior and relationships with others based on data with rich attributes. In this paper, we present ContactTree, a new ego-centered visualization technique designed to reveal patterns and trends in the data, and to facilitate reasoning about patterns or trends as well as comparison of interpersonal ties and contacts. The technique is based on a botanical tree metaphor. The tree is easy to construct and the resulting tree-like visualization can display many properties of the data. We have conducted two case studies to validate our method. The first study is based on a dataset consisting of two waves of 3-month contact diaries over 2004-2008. The second study uses a co-author network consisting of mainly information visualization researchers."
756,Visualizing InfoVis Researchers with ContactTrees,"This poster presents an application of ContactTree, a new ego-centered visualization design, to charactering the collaborative activities of selected InfoVis researchers in terms of their publications as listed in DBLP. The ContactTree visualization, based on a botanical tree metaphor, is designed for studying individuals and comparing their social behavior and relationships with others based on data with rich attributes. As shown, the resulting trees give each of the selected researchers a distinct look, and many interesting patterns reveal themselves. In social science research, the study of people's social contacts and activities is of high interest. ContactTree visualization well complements conventional network visualization, which is better for showing relations among people and activities in a global context."
757,ContactTrees: A Technique for Studying Personal Network Data,"Network visualization allows a quick glance at how nodes (or actors) are connected by edges (or ties). A conventional network diagram of ""contact tree"" maps out a root and branches that represent the structure of nodes and edges, often without further specifying leaves or fruits that would have grown from small branches. By furnishing such a network structure with leaves and fruits, we reveal details about ""contacts"" in our ContactTrees that underline ties and relationships. Our elegant design employs a bottom-up approach that resembles a recent attempt to understand subjective well-being by means of a series of emotions. Such a bottom-up approach to social-network studies decomposes each tie into a series of interactions or contacts, which help deepen our understanding of the complexity embedded in a network structure. Unlike previous network visualizations, ContactTrees can highlight how relationships form and change based upon interactions among actors, and how relationships and networks vary by contact attributes. Based on a botanical tree metaphor, the design is easy to construct and the resulting tree-like visualization can display many properties at both tie and contact levels, a key ingredient missing from conventional techniques of network visualization. We first demonstrate ContactTrees using a dataset consisting of three waves of 3-month contact diaries over the 2004-2012 period, then compare ContactTrees with alternative tools and discuss how this tool can be applied to other types of datasets."
758,Contact Trees: Network Visualization beyond Nodes and Edges,"Node-Link diagrams make it possible to take a quick glance at how nodes (or actors) in a network are connected by edges (or ties). A conventional network diagram of a ""contact tree"" maps out a root and branches that represent the structure of nodes and edges, often without further specifying leaves or fruits that would have grown from small branches. By furnishing such a network structure with leaves and fruits, we reveal details about ""contacts"" in our ContactTrees upon which ties and relationships are constructed. Our elegant design employs a bottom-up approach that resembles a recent attempt to understand subjective well-being by means of a series of emotions. Such a bottom-up approach to social-network studies decomposes each tie into a series of interactions or contacts, which can help deepen our understanding of the complexity embedded in a network structure. Unlike previous network visualizations, ContactTrees highlight how relationships form and change based upon interactions among actors, as well as how relationships and networks vary by contact attributes. Based on a botanical tree metaphor, the design is easy to construct and the resulting tree-like visualization can display many properties at both tie and contact levels, thus recapturing a key ingredient missing from conventional techniques of network visualization. We demonstrate ContactTrees using data sets consisting of up to three waves of 3-month contact diaries over the 2004-2012 period, and discuss how this design can be applied to other types of datasets."
759,Hilbert Tree of Life,
760,Implementation and Evaluation of an Enhanced H-tree Layout Pedigree Visualization,"The constant growth of available genealogical information has encouraged the research of visualization techniques capable of representing the corresponding large amount of data. An H-Tree Layout has been recently proposed to represent pedigree data as a way to overcome some of the limitations of traditional representations. However, this new method has its own limitations which may hinder its adoption. In this paper, we propose some enhancements to the H-Tree Layout pedigree visualization method in order to overcome some of the identified limitations. An implementation of the proposed enhancements and results of a preliminary evaluation are also provided."
761,Extending the H-Tree Layout Pedigree: An Evaluation,"Visualizing large family structures is becoming increasingly important, as more genealogical data becomes available. A space-filling h-tree layout pedigree has been recently proposed to make better use of the available space than traditional representations. In a previous paper we applauded the technique's usage of available space but remarked that it makes generation identification difficult and does not allow navigating to descendants of represented individuals. A set of extensions was proposed to help overcome these limitations and a preliminary evaluation suggested that those extensions enhance the original technique. This paper presents a more thorough evaluation carried out to assess if and how the proposed extensions improve the original h-tree layout pedigree technique. Results suggest that these extensions improve user performance on some tasks, effectively provide new functionality, and generally enhance user experience."
762,Browsing the Web Using Stacked Three-Dimensional Sunbursts to Visualize Term Co-Occurrences and Multimedia Content,"We present a novel visualization approach that extends the Sunburst technique to the third dimension, which allows for encoding additional data in the height of each arc segment. By stacking a number of such 3D-Sunbursts, we build a user interface for browsing collections of web pages. We apply techniques for web content indexing of multimedia data (text, audio, image, video) and text analysis to create a UI where each layer of the Sunburst stack represents a specific multimedia content type. We call this user interface the Co-Occurrence Browser (COB) and demonstrate its usability on a collection of web pages related to music artists."
763,The Clustergram: A graph for visualizing hierarchical and nonhierarchical cluster analyses,"In hierarchical cluster analysis, dendrograms are used to visualize how clusters are formed. I propose an alternative graph called a “clustergram” to examine how cluster members are assigned to clusters as the number of clusters increases. This graph is useful in exploratory analysis for nonhierarchical clustering algorithms such as k-means and for hierarchical cluster algorithms when the number of observations is large enough to make dendrograms impractical. I present the Stata code and give two examples."
764,Regular TreeMap Layouts for Visual Analysis of Hierarchical Data,"Hierarchical relationships play an utmost important role in many application domains. The appropriate visualization of hierarchically structured data sets can contribute towards supporting the data analyst in effectively analyzing hierarchic structures using visualization as a user friendly means to communicate information. Information Visualization has contributed a number of useful techniques for visualization of hierarchically structured data sets. Yet, the support for certain regularity requirements as arising from many data element types has to be improved. In this paper, we analyze an existing variant of the popular TreeMap family of hierarchical layout algorithms, and we introduce a novel TreeMap algorithm supporting space efficient layout of hierarchical data sets providing global regular layouts. We detail our algorithm, and we present applications on a real-world data set as well as experiments performed on a synthetic data set, showing its applicability and usefulness."
765,The Scaffold Tree -- Visualization of the Scaffold Universe by Hierarchical Scaffold Classification,"A hierarchical classification of chemical scaffolds (molecular framework, which is obtained by pruning all terminal side chains) has been introduced. The molecular frameworks form the leaf nodes in the hierarchy trees. By an iterative removal of rings, scaffolds forming the higher levels in the hierarchy tree are obtained. Prioritization rules ensure that less characteristic, peripheral rings are removed first. All scaffolds in the hierarchy tree are well-defined chemical entities making the classification chemically intuitive. The classification is deterministic, data-set-independent, and scales linearly with the number of compounds included in the data set. The application of the classification is demonstrated on two data sets extracted from the PubChem database, namely, pyruvate kinase binders and a collection of pesticides. The examples shown demonstrate that the classification procedure handles robustly synthetic structures and natural products."
766,A Point-Based Layout for Large Hierarchies,"Space-filling layout techniques for tree representations are frequently used when the available screen space is small or the data set is large. In this paper, we propose a new approach to space-filling tree representations, which uses mechanisms from the point-based rendering paradigm. We also numerically evaluate our new technique together with two established space-filling techniques using the measures of the Ink-Paper-Ratio and overplotted%."
767,Point-based tree representation: A new approach for large hierarchies,"Space-filling layout techniques for tree representations are frequently used when the available screen space is small or the data set is large. In this paper, we propose a new approach to space-filling tree representations, which uses mechanisms from the point-based rendering paradigm. Additionally, helpful interaction techniques that tie in with our layout are presented. We will relate our new technique to established space-filling techniques along the lines of a newly developed classification and also evaluate it numerically using the measures of the Ink-Paper-Ratio and overplotted%."
768,The Design Space of Implicit Hierarchy Visualization: A Survey,"Apart from explicit, node-link representations, implicit visualizations and especially the Treemap as their frontrunner have acquired a solid position among the available techniques to visualize hierarchies. Their advantage is an extremely space-efficient graphical representation that does not require explicit drawing of edges. In this paper, we survey the design space for this class of visualization techniques. For that purpose, we first establish the design space along the four axes of dimensionality, edge representation, node representation, and layout by examining most of the existing implicit hierarchy visualization techniques. The survey is completed by an outlook to the so far unexplored regions of the design space by giving a few examples of novel combinations of design parameters. Furthermore, we ensure that our design space is not a mere theoretical construct, but a practically usable tool for rapid visualization development by discussing and presenting a concrete software implementation of the introduced design space."
769,Point-Based Visualization for Large Hierarchies,"Space-filling layout techniques for tree representations are frequently used when the available screen space is small or the data set is large. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to space-filling tree representations, which uses mechanisms from the point-based rendering paradigm. We relate this new layout approach to common layout mechanisms and present helpful interaction techniques that tie in with our layout. Additionally, we compare and contrast the new layout with established space-filling techniques in a preliminary user study and along the lines of a numerical evaluation using the measures of the Ink-Paper-Ratio and overplotted%. The flexibility of the general approach is illustrated by several enhancements of the basic layout, as well as its usage within the context of two software frameworks from different application fields."
770,A Generative Layout Approach for Rooted Tree Drawings,"In response to the large number of existing tree layouts, generic ``meta-layouts'' have recently been proposed. These generic approaches utilize layout design spaces to pinpoint a tree drawing with desired characteristics in the wealth of available drawing options and parameters. While design-space-based generic layouts work well for the confined set of implicit space-filling tree layouts, they have so far eluded their extension to explicit node-link diagrams. In order to produce both, implicit and explicit tree layouts, this paper parts with the descriptive nature of the design spaces and instead takes a generative approach based on operators. As these operators can be combined into operator sequences and be used at different stages of the layout process, a small operator set already suffices to yield a large number of different tree layouts. To this end, we present a generic tree layout pipeline and give examples of suitable layout operators to plug into the pipeline. A prototypical implementation of our pipeline and operators is presented, and it is illustrated with space-filling and node-link examples. Furthermore, the paper presents results from a user study evaluating our generative approach as it is realized by the prototype."
771,"Analytical, visual and interactive concepts for geo-visual analytics","Supporting the visual analysis of structured multivariate geo-spatial data is a challenging task involving many different aspects. In this paper, we describe a systematic view of this task based on Chi's data state reference model. The analytical, visual and interaction components of the systematic view will be instantiated with specific examples that demonstrate how their tight interconnection facilitates exploration and analysis of geo-spatial data. In particular, we address the visualization of hierarchical structures on maps applying an extended focus+context concept. Moreover, we introduce an approach to extracting association rules from geo-spatial data and visualizing them on maps."
772,Arrangements of Planar Graphs on the Planar Lattice,
773,Tablorer -- An Interactive Tree Visualization System for Tablet PCs,"A variety of mobile devices are available today, but there is no dominant tree visualization system in the devices. This paper proposes Tablorer, a novel interactive tree visualization system for medium-sized mobile devices, especially for tablet PCs. The system shows the hierarchical information with a compact way using an expandable table format. For efficient navigation, the system provides an integrated view of context and focus information. The experimental results show that Tablorer can reduce the search time by about 22%."
774,Tree visualization with tree-maps: 2-d space-filling approach,"This paper presents a novel approach to representing trees that have weights or sizes on the leaf nodes. The 2-d visualization is space filling and the recursive algorithm for generation runs rapidly. It depends on color coding (or shading) of regions and easily provides users with a quick overview that clearly indicates relative sizes of the leaf nodes. Figures 3 and 4 show examples of tree-maps with size coding, as implemented by Brian Johnson on an Apple Macintosh II computer with a high resolution color display. Figure 3 shows fifteen files in four directories at three levels, with nested boxes to show the levels. Figure 4 represents actual disk directories encompassing 850 files at four levels with color coding by file type (text, graphics, applications, etc.). We continue to explore refinements of tree-maps such as alternate layouts, better methods for coping with large ranges of file size, color coding schemes and operations applied to files."
775,Ordered Treemap Layouts,"Treemaps, a space-filling method of visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms have been proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, and fail to preserve an ordering of the underlying data. This paper introduces the ordered treemap, which addresses these two shortcomings. The ordered treemap algorithm ensures that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials, we show that compared to other layout algorithms ordered treemaps are more stable while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A second test set uses stock market data."
776,TreeJuxtaposer InfoVis Contest Entry,"TreeJuxtaposer is a tool for interactive side-by-side tree comparison. Its two key innovations are the automatic marking of topological structural differences, and the guaranteed visibility of marked items. It uses the AccordionDrawer approach for layout and navigation, a multifocus global Focus+Context approach where stretching one part of the tree or screen causes the rest to shrink, and vice versa. Progressive rendering guarantees immediate interactive response even for large trees."
777,PRISAD: A partitioned rendering infrastructure for scalable accordion drawing,"We present PRISAD, the first generic rendering infrastructure for information visualization applications that use the accordion drawing technique: rubber sheet navigation with guaranteed visibility for marked areas of interest. Our new rendering algorithms are based on the partitioning of screen space, which allows us to handle dense dataset regions correctly. The algorithms in previous work led to incorrect visual representations because of overculling, and to inefficiencies due to overdrawing multiple items in the same region. Our pixel based drawing infrastructure guarantees correctness by eliminating overculling, and improves rendering performance with tight bounds on overdrawing. PRITree and PRISeq are applications built on PRISAD, with the feature sets of TreeJuxtaposer and SequenceJuxtaposer, respectively. We describe our PRITree and PRISeq dataset traversal algorithms, which are used for efficient rendering, culling, and layout of datasets within the PRISAD framework. We also discuss PRITree node marking techniques, which offer order-of-magnitude improvements to both memory and time performance versus previous range storage and retrieval techniques. Our PRITree implementation features a five fold increase in rendering speed for nontrivial tree structures, and also reduces memory requirements in some real world datasets by up to eight times, so we are able to handle trees of several million nodes. PRISeq renders fifteen times faster and handles datasets twenty times larger than previous work."
778,PRISAD: A Partitioned Rendering Infrastructure for Scalable Accordion Drawing (Extended Version),"We present PRISAD, the first generic rendering infrastructure for information visualization applications that use the accordion drawing technique: rubber-sheet navigation with guaranteed visibility for marked areas of interest. Our new rendering algorithms are based on the partitioning of screen-space, which allows us to handle dense data set regions correctly. The algorithms in previous work led to incorrect visual representations because of overculling, and to inefficiencies due to overdrawing multiple items in the same region. Our pixel-based drawing infrastructure guarantees correctness by eliminating over-culling, and improves rendering performance with tight bounds on overdrawing. PRITree and PRISeq are applications built on PRISAD, with the feature sets of TreeJuxtaposer and SequenceJuxtaposer, respectively. We describe our PRITree and PRISeq data set traversal algorithms, which are used for efficient rendering, culling, and layout of data sets within the PRISAD framework. We also discuss PRITree node marking techniques, which offer order-of-magnitude improvements to both memory and time performance vs previous range storage and retrieval techniques. Our PRITree implementation features a fivefold increase in rendering speed for non-trivial tree structures, and also reduces memory requirements in some real-world data sets by up to eight times, so we are able to handle trees of several million nodes. PRISeq renders 15 times faster and handles data sets 20 times larger than previous work. The software is available as open source from http://olduvai.sourceforge.net."
779,Using Treemaps for variable selection in spatio-temporal visualisation,"We demonstrate and reflect upon the use of enhanced treemaps that incorporate spatial and temporal ordering for exploring a large multivariate spatio-temporal data set. The resulting data-dense views summarise and simultaneously present hundreds of space-, time-, and variable-constrained subsets of a large multivariate data set in a structure that facilitates their meaningful comparison and supports visual analysis. Interactive techniques allow localised patterns to be explored and subsets of interest selected and compared with the spatial aggregate. Spatial variation is considered through interactive raster maps and high-resolution local road maps. The techniques are developed in the context of 42.2 million records of vehicular activity in a 98 sqkm area of central London and informally evaluated through a design used in the exploratory visualisation of this data set. The main advantages of our technique are the means to simultaneously display hundreds of summaries of the data and to interactively browse hundreds of variable combinations with ordering and symbolism that are consistent and appropriate for space- and time-based variables. These capabilities are difficult to achieve in the case of spatio-temporal data with categorical attributes using existing geovisualisation methods. We acknowledge limitations in the treemap representation but enhance the cognitive plausibility of this popular layout through our two-dimensional ordering algorithm and interactions. Patterns that are expected (e.g. more traffic in central London), interesting (e.g. the spatial and temporal distribution of particular vehicle types) and anomalous (e.g. low speeds on particular road sections) are detected at various scales and locations using the approach. In many cases, anomalies identify biases that may have implications for future use of the data set for analyses and applications. Ordered treemaps appear to have potential as interactive interfaces for variable selection in spatio-temporal visualisation."
780,Rectangular Hierarchical Cartograms for Socio-Economic Data,"We present rectangular hierarchical cartograms for mapping socio-economic data. These density-normalising cartograms size spatial units by population, increasing the ease with which data for densely populated areas can be visually resolved compared to more conventional cartographic projections. Their hierarchical nature enables the study of spatial granularity in spatial hierarchies, hierarchical categorical data and multivariate data through false hierarchies. They are space-filling representations that make efficient use of space and their rectangular nature (which aims to be as square as possible) improves the ability to compare the sizes (therefore population) of geographical units. We demonstrate these cartograms by mapping the Office for National Statistics Output Area Classification (OAC) by unit postcode (1.52 million in Great Britain) through the postcode hierarchy, using these to explore spatial variation. We provide rich and detailed spatial summaries of socio-economic characteristics of population as types of treemap, exploring the effects of reconfiguring them to study spatial and non-spatial aspects of the OAC classification."
781,Readable Layout of Unbalanced N-ary Trees,"The automatic layout of unbounded n-ary tree structures is a problem of subjectively meshing two independent goals: clarity and space efficiency. This paper presents a minimal set of subjective aesthetics which insures highly readable structures, without overly restricted flexibility in the layout of the tree. This flexibility underlies the algorithm's ability to produce readable trees with greater uniformity of node density throughout the display than achieved by previous algorithms, an especially useful characteristic where nodes are labelled with text."
782,Stable Treemaps via Local Moves,"Treemaps are a popular tool to visualize hierarchical data: items are represented by nested rectangles and the area of each rectangle corresponds to the data being visualized for this item. The visual quality of a treemap is commonly measured via the aspect ratio of the rectangles. If the data changes, then a second important quality criterion is the stability of the treemap: how much does the treemap change as the data changes. We present a novel stable treemapping algorithm that has very high visual quality. Whereas existing treemapping algorithms generally recompute the treemap every time the input changes, our algorithm changes the layout of the treemap using only local modifications. This approach not only gives us direct control over stability, but it also allows us to use a larger set of possible layouts, thus provably resulting in treemaps of higher visual quality compared to existing algorithms. We further prove that we can reach all possible treemap layouts using only our local modifications. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure for stability that better captures the relative positions of rectangles. We finally show via experiments on real-world data that our algorithm outperforms existing treemapping algorithms also in practice on either visual quality and/or stability. Our algorithm scores high on stability regardless of whether we use an existing stability measure or our new measure."
783,FlexTree: Visualising large quantities of hierarchical information,"Visualising large quantities of hierarchical information is a difficult topic in information visualisation and it has been attracting much effort since the emergence of this research area. The paper presents the FlexTree, an approach to visualising, navigating and analysing large hierarchies. It is based on the focus+context technique and combines the power of the histogram with traditional two dimensional (2D) node-link diagrams. This approach maintains the context of a large hierarchy while providing easy and consistent access to details of multiple focal points. Simple aesthetic rules and an interactive design were applied to the system. As a demonstration of the approach a computer file system hierarchy with 6,351 file folders and 130,400 files on a personal computer has been successfully visualised."
784,Multiple foci visualisation of large hierarchies with FlexTree,"One of the main tasks in information visualisation research is creating visual tools to facilitate human understanding of large and complex information spaces. Hierarchies, being a good mechanism for organising such information, are ubiquitous. Although much research effort has been spent on finding useful representations for hierarchies, visualising large hierarchies is still a difficult topic. One of the difficulties is how to handle the ever increasing scale of hierarchies. Another is how to enable the user to focus on multiple selections of interest while maintaining context. This paper describes a hierarchy visualisation technique called FlexTree to address these problems. It contains some important features that have not been exploited so far. A profile or contour unique to the hierarchy being visualised can be viewed in a bar chart layout. A normalised view of a common attribute of all nodes can be selected by the user. Multiple foci are consistently accessible within a global context through interaction. Furthermore it can handle a large hierarchy that contains 10,000 nodes in a PC environment. This technique has been applied to visualise computer file system structures and decision trees from data mining results. The results from informal user evaluations against these two applications are also presented. User feedback suggests that FlexTree is suitable for visualising large decision trees."
785,LensTree: Browsing and Navigating Large Hierarchical Information Structures,"This paper presents LensTree, a novel browsing and navigation tool for large hierarchical information structures. It enhances traditional indented lists by applying focus+context view to its design. LensTree dynamically changes the sizes of nodes to provide a focal area around the mouse pointer while keeping nodes in the peripheral area in smaller sizes as context. This enables it to display a larger hierarchy than traditional indented lists within the same screen area. Therefore scrolling and expanding/collapsing are less often used so that it is more efficient for performing browsing and navigation tasks. An informal user test was conducted and the users showed strong interest to LensTree's visual presentation. It suggested that this technique was worth further exploitation."
786,A comparative evaluation on tree visualization methods for hierarchical structures with large fan-outs,"Hierarchical structures with large fan-outs are hard to browse and understand. In the conventional node-link tree visualization, the screen quickly becomes overcrowded as users open nodes that have too many child nodes to fit in one screen. To address this problem, we propose two extensions to the conventional node-link tree visualization: a list view with a scrollbar and a multi-column interface. We compared them against the conventional tree visualization interface in a user study. Results show that users are able to browse and understand the tree structure faster with the multi-column interface than the other two interfaces. Overall, they also liked the multi-column better than others."
787,Rectangular Tree Browser: a Navigation and Visualization Tool for Large Hierarchies,"Hierarchies, also known as trees, is a good means to manage information. Therefore handling hierarchical data structures becomes an important task in the field of information visualization. Focus+context concept is a well-known strategy to cope with the representation of large collections of data. This concept has been applied to many tools for visualizing large hierarchies, such as Hyperbolic Browser, SpaceTree, DOI Tree, etc. Despite the success of these tools, they could not adequately utilize the display space. We propose a technique named Rectangular Tree Browser for the visualization and navigation of large hierarchies. The technique lays out the tree on an imaginary geometrical plane with the root in the center, and then transforms and maps the plane to a limited rectangle area rather than an ellipse area as Hyperbolic Browser does. Comparing with Hyperbolic Browser, our browser makes better use of the display space. Moreover, because regular user interface components are rectangular, by doing this transformation, the browser is easy to be integrated into a user interface that contains more components. We conducted an informal user test with five users performing navigation and selection tasks. Through observation and interview, we found that our users didn't experience any uncomfortability. We believe that Rectangular Tree Browser has the potential to be a good tool for navigation and visualization of large hierarchies."
788,"Focus+Context Display and Navigation Techniques for Enhancing Radial, Space-Filling Hierarchy Visualizations","Radial, space-filling visualizations can be useful for depicting information hierarchies, but they suffer from one major problem. As the hierarchy grows in size, many items become small, peripheral slices that are difficult to distinguish. We have developed three visualization/interaction techniques that provide flexible browsing of the display. The techniques allow viewers to examine the small items in detail while providing context within the entire information hierarchy. Additionally, smooth transitions between views help users maintain orientation within the complete information space."
789,An evaluation of space-filling information visualizations for depicting hierarchical structures,"A variety of information visualization tools have been developed recently, but relatively little effort has been made to evaluate the effectiveness and utility of the tools. This article describes results from two empirical studies of two visualization tools for depicting hierarchies, in particular, computer file and directory structures. The two tools examined implement space-filling methodologies, one rectangular, the Treemap method, and one circular, the Sunburst method. Participants performed typical file/directory search and analysis tasks using the two tools. In general, performance trends favored the Sunburst tool with respect to correct task performance, particularly on initial use. Performance with Treemap tended to improve over time and use, suggesting a greater learning cost that was partially recouped over time. Each tool afforded somewhat different search strategies, which also appeared to influence performance. Finally, participants strongly preferred the Sunburst tool, citing better ability to convey structure and hierarchy."
790,Representing development history in software cities,In this paper we describe a systematic approach to utilize the city metaphor for the visualization of large software systems as evolving software cities. The main contribution is a new layout approach which explicitly takes the development history of software systems into account and makes history directly visible in the layouts. These layouts incrementally evolve in a very smooth and stable way during the development of the represented software system. They are used as a visualization platform for integrating a large variety of product and process data and thus create a coherent set of specialized visualizations. To illustrate this we present some example maps capturing specific development history aspects.
791,Understanding software evolution with software cities,"Software cities are visualizations of software systems in the form of virtual cities. They are used as platforms to integrate a large variety of product- and process-related analysis data. Their usability, however, for real-world software development often suffers from their inability to appropriately deal with software changes. Even small structural changes can disrupt the overall structure of the city, which in turn corrupts the mental maps of its users. In this article we describe a systematic approach to utilize the city metaphor for the visualization of evolving software systems as growing software cities. The main contribution is a new layout approach which explicitly takes the development history of software systems into account. The approach has two important effects: first, it creates a stable gestalt of software cities even when the underlying software systems evolve; thus, by preserving its users’ mental maps these cities are especially suitable for use during ongoing system development. Second, it makes history directly visible in the city layouts, which allows for supporting novel analysis scenarios. We illustrate such scenarios by presenting several thematic cities’ maps, each capturing specific development history aspects."
792,Optimal orientations of cells in slicing floorplan designs,"A methodology of VLSI layout described by several authors first determines the relative positions of indivisible pieces, called cells, on the chip. Various optimizations are then performed on this initial layout to minimize some cost measure such as chip area or perimeter. If each cell is a rectangle with given dimensions, one optimization problem is to choose orientations of all the cells to minimize the cost measure. A polynomial time algorithm is given for this optimization problem for layouts of a special type called slicings. However, orientation optimization for more general layouts is shown to be NP-complete (in the strong sense)."
793,Method and apparatus for displaying data within a three-dimensional information landscape,A method and apparatus are presented for displaying three-dimensional navigable display space containing an aggregation of graphical objects and an overview of the aggregation of display objects. An altered perspective is provided by compressing the horizontal dimension of the displayed objects so that a user can see a representative overview of the entire aggregation of display objects that have been selected for display together on a display screen. The compressed component is expanded so that the objects appear wider as a navigator approaches the displayed objects. A spotlight shines down on objects responsive to a data query. The spotlight serves as a navigation aid to the navigator so that highlighted items are visible from a distance and can be easily located. The user's view of the display space is altered so that the navigator perceives that he is traveling in a straight line when approaching a display object in a display space in which the horizontal dimension of displayed objects is compressed in accordance with the apparent distance between a displayed object and the navigator.
794,Method and apparatus for navigation within three-dimensional information landscape,"A method and apparatus for navigating within a three dimensional graphic display space and manipulating information and data represented by objects in display space. The method and apparatus presents users with a vastly expanded view of their data, displayed with a richer dimensionality. Data objects represented by graphic objects are arranged into a navigable landscape representing the containership and contextual relations of the underlying data. The graphic objects are columns, pedestals and disks, which represent data blocks, cells, and comparative values respectively. The columns rest on the pedestals. The disks are located with respect to the top of the column to signify a comparative attribute. The pedestal rest upon a ground plane. The ground plane represents a threshold value. Data attributes may be represented by visual, textual, executable, or audible characteristics of the display. The user may interact with the data to affect change in the underlying data or its representation within the display space. Less detail is displayed as the user navigates away from objects within the display space. Objects change from three-dimensional to two-dimensional, to line segments as the user moves away from the objects. Visible attributes such as text and icons are not displayed for distant objects."
795,Fast Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps,"The Voronoi Treemap is a space-filling treemap technique that relaxes the constraints of rectangular nodes. Its organic shapes maintain a one-to-one aspect ratio, are flexible with their placement, allowing stable zooming and dynamic data values. In this paper, we present algorithms for efficient computation and dynamic update of Voronoi Treemaps. Our GPGPU-based technique allows for rapid computation of centroidal Voronoi Diagrams, providing almost two orders of magnitude speedup over previous work. In addition, we present a hierarchical algorithm for stable updates. Finally, we demonstrate the application of Voronoi treemaps to real-world dynamic datasets, including interactive navigation."
796,Nested Pie Chart,"A pie chart divides a circle or ellipse into slices, where the size and color of each slice is based on some attributes of the elements it represents. For example, one can show the constituents of a stock porfolio in a pie-chart, where each slice will be occupied by one stock and the size of the slice will be decided by the total value of the portfolio, and the color determined by percentage price change. A Nested Pie Chart extends the functionality of a pie-chart by adding letting it represent a tree data model, thus making it a elliptical heatmap."
797,A Low Complexity Recursive Force-Directed Tree Layout Algorithm Based on the Lennard-Jones Potential,"In this paper, a low complexity force-directed tree layout algorithm based on the Lennard-Jones potential is described. The recursive method lays out sub-trees as small disks contained in their parent disk. Inside each disk, children disks are dynamically laid out using a new force directed simulation. Unlike most other force directed layout methods which run in quadratic time for each simulation step, this algorithm runs in O(n**(m+1)/m) time per each step for a tree with n nodes, depth m and all the nodes having uniform number of children. The layout uses space efficiently and reflects both global structure and local detail. The method supports runtime insertion and deletion. Both operations and the evolving process are rendered with smooth animation to preserve visual continuity. The method could be used to monitor in real time, visualize and analyze a wide variety of data which has a rooted tree structure, e.g. internet hosts could be laid out by domain name (DNS) hierarchies. This paper gives a description of the algorithm, a complexity analysis and an example of how the algorithm is implemented to visualize DNS tree."
798,FROTH -- A force-directed representation of tree hierarchies,"FROTH is the implementation of a low complexity force-directed tree layout algorithm based on the Lennard-Jones potential. The recursive method lays out sub-trees as small disks contained in their parent disk. Inside each disk, children disks are dynamically laid out using a new force directed simulation. Unlike most other force-directed layout methods which run in quadratic time for each simulation step, this algorithm runs in $O(n^m+1/m)$ time per each step for a tree with $n$ nodes, depth $m$ and all the nodes having uniform number of children. The layout uses space efficiently and reflects both global structure and local detail. The method supports runtime insertion and deletion. Both operations and the evolving process are rendered with smooth animation to preserve visual continuity. The method could be used to monitor in real time, visualize and analyze a wide variety of data which has a rooted tree structure, e.g. internet hosts could be laid out by domain name (DNS) hierarchies."
799,Enhanced spatial stability with Hilbert and Moore Treemaps,"Treemaps are a well known and powerful space-filling visualisation method for displaying hierarchical data. Many alternative treemap algorithms have been proposed, often with the aim being to optimise performance across several criteria, including spatial stability to assist users in locating and monitoring items of interest. In this paper we demonstrate that spatial stability is not fully captured by the commonly used `distance change' metric, and we introduce a new `location drift' metric to more fully capture spatial stability. An empirical study examines the validity and usefulness of the location drift metric, showing that it explains some effects on user performance that distance change does not. Next, we introduce `Hilbert' and `Moore' treemap algorithms, which are designed to achieve high spatial stability. We assess their performance in comparison to other treemaps, showing that Hilbert and Moore treemaps perform well across all stability metrics."
800,AdaptiviTree: Adaptive Tree Visualization for Tournament-Style Brackets,"Online pick'em games, such as the recent NCAA college basketball March Madness tournament, form a large and rapidly growing industry. In these games, players make predictions on a tournament bracket that defines which competitors play each other and how they proceed toward a single champion. Throughout the course of the tournament, players monitor the brackets to track progress and to compare predictions made by multiple players. This is often a complex sense making task. The classic bracket visualization was designed for use on paper and utilizes an incrementally additive system in which the winner of each match-up is rewritten in the next round as the tournament progresses. Unfortunately, this representation requires a significant amount of space and makes it relatively difficult to get a quick overview of the tournament state since competitors take arbitrary paths through the static bracket. In this paper, we present AdaptiviTree, a novel visualization that adaptively deforms the representation of the tree and uses its shape to convey outcome information. AdaptiviTree not only provides a more compact and understandable representation, but also allows overlays that display predictions as well as other statistics. We describe results from a lab study we conducted to explore the efficacy of AdaptiviTree, as well as from a deployment of the system in a recent real-world sports tournament."
801,Adaptive tree visualization for tournament-style brackets,"An adaptive tree visualization system and method for adaptively deforming a traditional bracket tree to visualize information about competitors in a linear manner. A one-dimensional result line emanates from the name of each competitor such that the progress of each competitor can be immediately determined by examining the length of the competitor's result line. The result line typically is composed of multiple result line segments. Each line segment spans a particular time period column to indicate that the competitor is matched up with another competitor during that time period. A pending result line segment spans the adjacent time period to indicate that the results of the match-up are unknown. Once the result of the match-up is known, the pending result line is added to the result line segment of the winning competitor. This extends the winner's result line into the next time period while the loser's result line remains unchanged."
802,Treecube: Visualization Tool for Browsing 3D Multimedia Data,"This paper proposes a new 3D visualization tool for hierarchical information. A 2D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treemap has already been proposed by Ben Shneiderman, et al. in 1992. In general, hierarchical information is represented as a tree structure. Treemap hierarchically lays out each node as a bounding box, whose size is the same as the specific weight or attribute value of the node. After the original treemap algorithm called slice-and-dice, some extensions to it have been proposed: squarified treemap, ordered treemap and strip treemap. Furthermore, quantum treemap is a quantization version of these extensions. In this paper, the authors propose a new 3D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treecube that can be taken as a 3D extension of treemap. Especially, this paper shows its usefulness for browsing 3D multimedia data, i.e., 2D images, 3D shape models, motion data, etc., originally stored in a file system."
803,Interactive Interfaces of Treecube for Browsing 3D Multimedia Data,"The authors of this paper have already proposed Treecube which is a visualization tool for browsing 3D multimedia data. In this paper, the authors also propose its interactive interfaces for efficiently browsing 3D multimedia data. Treecube is regarded as a 3D extension of treemap, which is a visualization tool for hierarchical information proposed by Ben Shneiderman et al. in 1992. For treemap, there are several layout algorithms: slice-and-dice, ordered treemap, strip treemap and so on. Furthermore, quantum treemap exists. It means a quantization version of these treemap layout algorithms. The authors implemented mainly three layout algorithms, i.e., slice-and-dice, ordered and strip treecube algorithm, and implemented their quantization version. Practically sophisticated interfaces are necessary for efficiently browsing 3D multimedia data. In this paper, the authors also propose such interfaces. The authors implemented mainly five interface functionalities for the following operations. (1) ""Cutting plane"" concept to solve the occlusion problem, i.e., nodes located before the plane are hidden to make it easy to see inside nodes. (2) The control of node frames, i.e., their brightness and thickness, for easily understanding the hierarchical structure of nodes. (3) Standard operations for the translation and the rotation of an eye position, and for the zoom in/out. (4) Particular operations for the extraction of the user focus node and for the backward/forward for browsing such node. The authors also implemented (5) a function to assign color information to any node properties because color is the most important factor of the visual display properties."
804,Visualizing Time-Dependent Data in Multivariate Hierarchic Plots -- Design and Evaluation of an Economic Application,"For successfully competing in a modern economy, large amounts of hierarchic time-dependent data need to be analyzed. As an example, one could consider the geographic composition of inflation in the European Union, or the revenue by product (sub) categories of a firm in the last month. Analysts wish to interpret the structure of the data not only at a single point in time, but examine the changes in the data categories through time. The analysts may need to consider additional dimensions to composition and time, such as the growth rate or profit rate. To reflect such analytic requirements, we have developed an interactive visualization of multi-dimensional, structured data taking the time dimension into account. The data are displayed in a three dimensional hierarchic circular or column plot. The time dimension of the data is represented by animation. Our system provides interactive tools for the visual data analysis and variable set-up of the data display. For better orientation in the data space, we have enhanced the visualization with smooth transitions between different data selections in case of 3D hierarchic plots. The techniques presented can be applied to various data domains. A user study using European inflation data has shown the usefulness for effective economic analysis."
805,Data Quality Visualization for Multivariate Hierarchic Data,"In many business applications, decision makers often have to base their decisions on large amounts of data from various sources. Often, the quality of this data varies substantially, affecting the degree of certainty the analyst can put into the analyzed data values. The data quality measures may be of qualitative or quantitative nature, and consist of one or many dimensions. In this poster paper, we first present a brief survey of currently available uncertainty visualization techniques. We then present experimental results we obtained with several techniques for visualization of multidimensional data quality information, applied on multivariate hierarchic data used in an economic data analysis scenario."
806,Combining extended Table Lens and Treemap techniques for visualizing tabular data,"We present a framework for visualizing large tabular data that combines two views: the table view and the treemap view. The table view extends the known table lens as follows: We cluster related elements to reduce subsampling artifacts and achieve table size independent rendering time; we use multiple-column sorting to create scenariospecific data hierarchies on the fly; and we use shaded cushions to show data structure and variation. Hierarchies built in the table view are shown in a customizable treemap view. One can choose both layout and rendering by a few clicks, effectively creating visual scenarios on-the-fly. We illustrate our framework on real-life stock data."
807,RINGS: A Technique for Visualizing Large Hierarchies,"We present RINGS, a technique for visualizing large trees. We introduce a new ringed circular layout of nodes to make more efficient use of limited display space. RINGS provides the user with the means to specify areas of primary andsecond ary focus, andis able to show multiple foci without compromising understanding of the graph. The strength of RINGS is its ability to show more area in focus andmore contextual information than existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RINGS by applying it to the visualization of a Unix file directory."
808,"PaintingClass: Interactive construction, visualization and exploration of decision trees","Decision trees are commonly used for classification. We propose to use decision trees not just for classification but also for the wider purpose of knowledge discovery, because visualizing the decision tree can reveal much valuable information in the data. We introduce PaintingClass, a system for interactive construction, visualization and exploration of decision trees. PaintingClass provides an intuitive layout and convenient navigation of the decision tree. PaintingClass also provides the user the means to interactively construct the decision tree. Each node in the decision tree is displayed as a visual projection of the data. Through actual examples and comparison with other classification methods, we show that the user can effectively use PaintingClass to construct a decision tree and explore the decision tree to gain additional knowledge."
809,FSN: The 3D file system navigator,
810,"Method, system, and computer program product for visualizing data using partial hierarchies","A method, system, and computer program product provides data visualization which optimizes visualization of and navigation through hierarchies. A partial hierarchy is generated and displayed. The partial hierarchy consists of a number levels at least equal to a predetermined depth and less than a total number of levels included in a corresponding complete hierarchy. Parent nodes in the bottom level of the partial hierarchy have segments of connection lines extending toward child nodes not included in the partial hierarchy. A user is permitted to mark selected nodes or locations in a displayed partial hierarchy. Partial hierarchies are generated and stored in a cache or generated on-the-fly. Each partial hierarchy ends at a progressively deeper level. An interpolator interpolates a partial hierarchy layout by interpolating corresponding nodes in two partial hierarchies. A hierarchy manager manages partial hierarchies in response to requests from a viewer to move a camera to camera positions. Partial hierarchies are fetched from the cache or the interpolator. A display then displays display views of fetched partial hierarchies corresponding to the camera positions. During free-form navigation, a hierarchy manager determines and maintain an orientation based on at least one reference object. During zooming, an angular orientation is maintained through successive partial hierarchies. Mapping is also provided between a three-dimensional 3D partial hierarchy and a two-dimensional 2D overview of a complete hierarchy."
811,Method of generating and navigating a 3-D representation of a hierarchical data structure,"A method of generating a graphical representation of a hierarchical data structure to on a display unit, the hierarchical data structure including a first node having at least one content item. A graphic tree representative of the hierarchical data structure is displayed on the display unit, the graphic tree including a first graphic representation of the first node. A second graphic representation, associated with the first graphic representation, that provides a representation of a content item (e.g., a file) is displayed on the display unit, the second graphic representation differing in appearance from the first graphic representation."
812,Treemap display with minimum cell size,"A treemap with cells that have a minimum size so that large data sets can be clearly represented. A treemap that represents a plurality of data elements is generated, the treemap including a plurality of two-dimensional cells. Each cell represents a corresponding data element in the data set. The treemap includes a portion of a display screen assigned to a first cell so that the first cell has a size. A portion of the display screen is then assigned to a subsequent cell. The size of the first cell is adjusted in order to compensate for a size of the subsequent cell and to maintain the minimum cell size."
813,Kaleidoscope visualization of fine-grain parallel programs,"A software visualization tool is described that transforms program execution trace data from a multiprocessor into a single, color image. The image is essentially the program's logical procedure-invocation tree, displayed radially from the root. An algorithm is described that condenses the image both radially and laterally, producing a color-dense abstraction of the program's execution behavior: a program signature, within a workstation window. An implementation of the tool was made in X-Windows, including a user interface that can zoom the image and annotate any node in the image with the corresponding procedure-invocation data. Experimentation with the system was performed with trace data from Panda, a concurrent logic programming system on shared-memory multiprocessors. The authors demonstrate how the tool helps the programmer develop intuitions about parallel performance and how condensation successfully abstracts very large traces."
814,Fisheye Tree Views and Lenses for Graph Visualization,"We present interactive visual aids to support the exploration and navigation of graph layouts. They include fisheye tree views and composite lenses. These views provide, in an integrated manner, overview+detail and focus+context. Fisheye tree views are novel applications of the well known fisheye distortion technique. They facilitate the exploration of the hierarchy trees associated with clustered graphs. Composite lenses are the result of the integration of several lens techniques. They facilitate the display of local graph information that may be otherwise difficult to grasp in large and dense graph layouts"
815,Circular Tree Drawing by simulating network synchronisation dynamics and scaling,We present an algorithm which produces circular-shape layouts of trees by simulating synchronisation dynamics on the tree. Our approach consists of evolving scalar dynamical values assigned to the nodes. Then the dissimilarities between the values of each pair of nodes are utilised to calculate the coordinates of the nodes by using a lower bound on dissimilarities and scaling up the lower bound per iteration.
816,Interactive Rendering of Complex 3D-Treemaps,"3D-Treemaps are an important visualization technique for hierarchical views. In contrast to 2D-Treemaps, height can be used to map one additional attribute of the data items. Using the Treemap technique in combination with large datasets (more than 500k) a fast rendering and interaction techniques that are beyond collapsing/uncollapsing nodes is still one of the main challenges. This paper presents a novel rendering technique that enables the image synthesis of geometrical complex 3D-Treemaps in real-time. The fully hardware accelerated approach is based on shape generation using geometry shaders. This approach offers increased rendering performance and low update latency compared to existing techniques and through it enables new real-time interaction techniques to large datasets."
817,HierarchyMap: A Novel Approach to Treemap Visualization of Hierarchical Data,
818,Visualizing Changes of Hierarchical Data using Treemaps,"While the treemap is a popular method for visualizing hierarchical data, it is often difficult for users to track layout and attribute changes when the data evolve over time. When viewing the treemaps side by side or back and forth, there exist several problems that can prevent viewers from performing effective comparisons. Those problems include abrupt layout changes, a lack of prominent visual patterns to represent layouts, and a lack of direct contrast to highlight differences. In this paper, we present strategies to visualize changes of hierarchical data using treemaps. A new treemap layout algorithm is presented to reduce abrupt layout changes and produce consistent visual patterns. Techniques are proposed to effectively visualize the difference and contrast between two treemap snapshots in terms of the map items' colors, sizes, and positions. Experimental data show that our algorithm can achieve a good balance in maintaining a treemap's stability, continuity, readability, and average aspect ratio. A software tool is created to compare treemaps and generate the visualizations. User studies show that the users can better understand the changes in the hierarchy and layout, and more quickly notice the color and size differences using our method."
819,Improving the visualization of hierarchies with treemaps: Design Issues and Experimentation,"Controlled experiments with novice treemap users and real data highlight the strengths of treemaps and provide direction for improvement. Issues discussed include experimental results, layout algorithms, nesting offsets, labeling, animation, and small multiple displays. Treemaps prove to be a potent tool for hierarchy display. The principles discussed are applicable to many information visualization situations."
820,"PedVis: A Structured, Space-Efficient Technique for Pedigree Visualization","Public genealogical databases are becoming increasingly populated with historical data and records of the current population's ancestors. As this increasing amount of available information is used to link individuals to their ancestors, the resulting trees become deeper and more dense, which justifies the need for using organized, space-efficient layouts to display the data. Existing layouts are often only able to show a small subset of the data at a time. As a result, it is easy to become lost when navigating through the data or to lose sight of the overall tree structure. On the contrary, leaving space for unknown ancestors allows one to better understand the tree's structure, but leaving this space becomes expensive and allows fewer generations to be displayed at a time. In this work, we propose that the H-tree based layout be used in genealogical software to display ancestral trees. We will show that this layout presents an increase in the number of displayable generations, provides a nicely arranged, symmetrical, intuitive and organized fractal structure, increases the user's ability to understand and navigate through the data, and accounts for the visualization requirements necessary for displaying such trees. Finally, user-study results indicate potential for user acceptance of the new layout."
821,Space efficient visualization of pedigree data,"A method of visually representing pedigree data is provided. A root individual in a genealogical dataset is identified. A first parent and a second parent of the identified root individual are identified from the genealogical dataset. A third parent and a fourth parent of the identified first parent are identified from the genealogical dataset. A pedigree visualization relative to the identified root individual is presented which includes a root indicator, a first parent indicator, a second parent indicator, a third parent indicator, and a fourth parent indicator. The first parent indicator is presented in a first direction relative to the root indicator, the second parent indicator is presented in a second direction relative to the root indicator, wherein the second direction is opposite the first direction, the third parent indicator is presented in a third direction relative to the first parent indicator, wherein the third direction is perpendicular to the first direction, and the fourth parent indicator is presented in a fourth direction relative to the first parent indicator, wherein the fourth direction is opposite the third direction."
822,New approaches in graph visualization,
823,Gyrolayout: A Hyperbolic Level-of-Detail Tree Layout,"Many large datasets can be represented as hierarchical structures,introducing not only the necessity of specialized tree visualization techniques, but also the requirements of handling large amounts of data and offering the user a useful insightinto them. Many two-dimensional techniques have been developed, but 3-dimensional ones, together with navigational interactions, present a promising appropriate tool todeal with large trees. In this paper we present a hyperbolic tree layout extended to support different level-of-detail techniques and suitable for large tree representation and visualization. This layout permits the visualization of large trees with different level of detail in anenclosed 3-dimensional volume. As a significant part of the layout, we also present a Weighted Spherical Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation, an extension of planar Weighted Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations, in order to find an appropriate distribution of nodes on a spherical surface."
824,Pretty-printing of trees,"A pleasing layout of printed tree structures is difficult to achieve automatically. The paper points out three main problems. First, the horizontal position of a node on the printed page depends on global consideration of the position of other nodes; secondly, the physical characteristics of printers require scanning the tree in left-to-right top-to-bottom sequence; finally, page overflow for wide trees must be handled. These problems are illustrated by analysing the shortcomings of a simple printing algorithm. A suitable general binary tree printing algorithm is presented and its adaptation to other types of trees is shown."
825,Understanding sequence and reply relationships within email conversations: a mixed-model visualization,"It has been proposed that email clients could be improved if they presented messages grouped into conversations. An email conversation is the tree of related messages that arises from the use of the reply operation. We propose two models of conversation. The first model characterizes a conversation as a chronological sequence of messages; the second as a tree based on the reply relationship. We show how existing email clients and prior research projects implicitly support each model to a greater or lesser degree depending on their design, but none fully supports both models simultaneously. We present a mixed-model visualization that simultaneously presents sequence and reply relationships among the messages of a conversation, making both visible at a glance. We describe the integration of the visualization into a working prototype email client. A usability study indicates that the system meets our usability goals and verifies that the visualization fully conveys both types of relationships within the messages of an email conversation."
826,Angle-Restricted Steiner Arborescences for Flow Map Layout,"We introduce a new variant of the geometric Steiner arborescence problem, motivated by the layout of flow maps. Flow maps show the movement of objects between places. They reduce visual clutter by bundling lines smoothly and avoiding self-intersections. To capture these properties, our angle-restricted Steiner arborescences, or flux trees, connect several targets to a source with a tree of minimal length whose arcs obey a certain restriction on the angle they form with the source. We study the properties of optimal flux trees and show that they are planar and consist of logarithmic spirals and straight lines. Flux trees have the shallow-light property. We show that computing optimal flux trees is NP-hard. Hence we consider a variant of flux trees which uses only logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees approximate flux trees within a factor depending on the angle restriction. Computing optimal spiral trees remains NP-hard, but we present an efficient 2-approximation, which can be extended to avoid ""positive monotone""' obstacles."
827,Modifiable Treemaps Containing Variable-Shaped Units,"This paper presents a novel method, for the visualization of hierarchical information such as directory structures or family trees. Our technique is based on nested Treemaps and inherits the main property of the Treemaps: space-filling display of hierarchical information. For each node, our technique allocates a bounding box according to a ratio (height/width) that can be modified by the user according to her/his task. To do so, our algorithm does not apply the slice and dice (top-down) approach of standard Treemaps. Our technique is effective, easy to implement and has a wide applicability. To illustrate its application, we developed a system called PARENT which displays a directory tree. PARENT is tightly coupled with Microsoft Windows Explorer."
828,Visualization techniques for circular tabletop interfaces,"This paper presents visualization and layout schemes developed for a novel circular user interface designed for a round, tabletop display. Since all the displayed items are in a polar coordinate system, many interface and visualization schemes must be revisited to account for this new layout of UI elements. We discuss the direct implications of such a circular interface on document orientation. We describe two types of fisheye deformation of the circular layout and explain how to use them in a multi-person collaborative interface. These two schemes provide a general layout framework for circular interfaces. We have also designed a new visualization technique derived from the particularities of the circular layout we have highlighted. In this technique the user controls the layout of the elements of a hierarchical tree. Our approach is to provide the user rich interaction possibilities to easily and quickly produce a layout comparable to the hyperbolic view developed at Xerox PARC. The visualization work presented in this paper is part of our ongoing Personal Digital Historian (PDH) research project. The overall goal of PDH is to investigate ways to effectively and intuitively organize, navigate, browse, present and visualize digital data in an interactive multi-person conversational setting."
829,Google+ Ripples: A native visualization of information flow,"G+ Ripples is a visualization of information flow that shows users how public posts are shared on Google+. Unlike other social network visualizations, Ripples exists as a ""native"" visualization: it is directly accessible from public posts on Google+. This unique position leads to both new constraints and new possibilities for design. We describe the visualization technique, which is a new mix of node-and-link and circular treemap metaphors. We then describe user reactions as well as some of the patterns of sharing that are made evident by the Ripples visualization."
830,Visualizing Business Data with Generalized Treemaps,"Business data is often presented using simple business graphics. These familiar visualizations are effective for providing overviews, but fall short for the presentation of large amounts of detailed information. Treemaps can provide such detail, but are often not easy to understand. We present how standard treemap algorithms can be adapted such that the results mimic familiar business graphics. Specifically, we present the use of different layout algorithms per level, a number of variations of the squarified algorithm, the use of variable borders, and the use of non-rectangular shapes. The combined use of these leads to histograms, pie charts and a variety of other styles."
831,A node-positioning algorithm for general trees,"Drawing a tree consists of two stages: determining the position of each node, and actually rendering the individuals nodes and interconnecting branches. The algorithm described in this paper is concerned with the first stage: given a list of nodes, an indication of the hierarchical relationship among them, and their shape and size, where should each node be positioned for optimal aesthetic effect? This algorithm determines the positions of the nodes for any arbitrary general tree. It is the most desirable positioning with respect to certain widely-accepted heuristics. The positioning, specified in x, y co-ordinates, minimizes the width of the tree. In a general tree, there is no limit on the number of offspring per node; this contrasts with binary and ternary trees, for example, which are trees with a limit of two and three offspring per node. This algorithm operates in time O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Previously, most tree drawings have been positioned by the sure hand of a human graphic designer. Many computer-generated positionings have been either trivial or contained irregularities. Earlier work by Wetherell and Shannon1 and Tilford,2 upon which this algorithm builds, failed to position the interior nodes of some trees correctly. The algorithm presented here correctly positions a tree's node using only two passes. It also handles several practical considerations: alternative orientations of the tree, variable node sizes and out-of-bounds conditions. Radack, also building on Tilford's work, has solved this same problem with a different algorithm which makes four passes."
832,Visualization of Large Hierarchical Data by Circle Packing,In this paper a novel approach is described for tree visualization using nested circles. The brother nodes at the same level are represented by externally tangent circles; the tree nodes at different levels are displayed by using 2D nested circles or 3D nested cylinders. A new layout algorithm for tree structure is described. It provides a good overview for large data sets. It is easy to see all the branches and leaves of the tree. The new method has been applied to the visualization of file systems.
833,CropCircles: Topology Sensitive Visualization of OWL Class Hierarchies,"OWL ontologies present many interesting visualization challenges. Here we present CropCircles, a technique designed to view the class hierarchies in ontologies as trees. We place special emphasis on topology understanding when designing the tool. We drew inspiration from treemaps, but made substantial changes in the representation and layout. Most notably, the spacefillingness of treemap is relaxed in exchange for visual clarity. We outline the problem scape of visualizing ontology hierarchies, note the requirements that go into the design of the tool, and discuss the interface and implementation. Finally, through a controlled experiment involving tasks common to understanding ontologies, we show the benefits of our design."
834,Geometry based visualization of hierarchical structures,"Hierarchical structures are a common organization of data in the real world. In this paper, we propose a new type of tree structures called diamond tree to present the organization and relationship of hierarchical data. We design a spatial layout using the geometric theory, starting with a simple design and continually improving until the design that makes the best use of the screen estate. Finally, we use the diamond tree method to analyze the structure of Tianjin University website."
835,Orthogonal Voronoi Diagram and Treemap,"In this paper, we propose a novel space partitioning strategy for implicit hierarchy visualization such that the new plot not only has a tidy layout similar to the treemap, but also is flexible to data changes similar to the Voronoi treemap. To achieve this, we define a new distance function and neighborhood relationship between sites so that space will be divided by axis-aligned segments. Then a sweepline+skyline based heuristic algorithm is proposed to allocate the partitioned spaces to form an orthogonal Voronoi diagram with orthogonal rectangles. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to use a sweepline-based strategy for the Voronoi treemap. Moreover, we design a novel strategy to initialize the diagram status and modify the status update procedure so that the generation of our plot is more effective and efficient. We show that the proposed algorithm has an O(nlog(n)) complexity which is the same as the state-of-the-art Voronoi treemap. To this end, we show via experiments on the artificial dataset and real-world dataset the performance of our algorithm in terms of computation time, converge rate, and aspect ratio. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of our method and make a conclusion."

This display method, which builds on Shneiderman's treemap technique, makes use of both hierarchy and similarity information. We have implemented this display in the SmartMoney Map of the Market, a web page that reports current data on over 500 publicly traded companies."
839,A Model of Multi-Scale Perceptual Organization in Information Graphics,"We propose a new method for assessing the perceptual organization of information graphics, based on the premise that the visual structure of an image should match the structure of the data it is intended to convey. The core of our method is a new formal model of one type of perceptual structure, based on classical machine vision techniques for analyzing an image at multiple resolutions. The model takes as input an arbitrary grayscale image and returns a lattice structure describing the visual organization of the image. We show how this model captures several aspects of traditional design aesthetics, and we describe a software tool that implements the model to help designers analyze and refine visual displays. Our emphasis here is on demonstrating the model's potential as a design aid rather than as a description of human perception, but given its initial promise we propose a variety of ways in which the model could be extended and validated."

841,A Note on Space-Filling Visualizations and Space-Filling Curves,"A recent line of treemap research has focused on layout algorithms that optimize properties such as stability, preservation of ordering information, and aspect ratio of rectangles. No ideal treemap layout algorithm has been found, and so it is natural to explore layouts that produce non-rectangular regions. This note describes a connection between space-filling visualizations and the mathematics of space-filling curves, and uses that connection to characterize a family of layout algorithms which produce nonrectangular regions but enjoy geometric continuity under changes to the data and legibility even for highly unbalanced trees."
842,"The Word Tree, an Interactive Visual Concordance","We introduce the Word Tree, a new visualization and information-retrieval technique aimed at text documents. A Word Tree is a graphical version of the traditional ""keyword-in-context"" method, and enables rapid querying and exploration of bodies of text. In this paper we describe the design of the technique, along with some of the technical issues that arise in its implementation. In addition, we discuss the results of several months of public deployment of word trees on Many Eyes, which provides a window onto the ways in which users obtain value from the visualization."
843,Space-filling Techniques in Visualizing Output from Computer Based Economic Models,"One important factor concerning economic models is that frequently large amounts of data are produced. There is the research issue of how end-users (who may not be researchers or model developers) can be presented with this data so that maximum benefits can be attained from the data production. The usual approach with economic models is a series of tables or data series plots. In this paper we use space-filling information visualization techniques as an aid to userā€™s understanding of data from an economic model. Based upon evaluation of the effectiveness of existing treemap and sunburst techniques through user experimentation, we introduce two new space-filling visualization techniques. We also describe fisheye-lens techniques applicable to these new visualizations."
844,A ZoomTree interface for searching genealogical information,"Genealogical information systems (GIS) typically contain large amounts of information about families and relationships between family members. Most existing GIS have textual, form-based interfaces for searching and browsing family information. These interfaces do not support dynamic browsing and manipulation of family trees. This paper discusses the design and development of a novel interface, called ZoomTree, for WINGIS (the GIS developed at UPE), to facilitate dynamic exploration and browsing of family tree information."
845,Tidy Drawings of Trees,"Trees are extremely common data structures, both as internal objects and as models for program output. But it is unusual to see a program actually draw trees for visual inspection. Although part of the difficulty lies in programming graphics devices, most of the problem arises because naive algorithms to draw trees use too much drawing space and sophisticated algorithms are not obvious. We survey two naive tree drawers, formalize aesthetics for tidy trees, and descnbe two algorithms which draw tidy trees. One of the algorithms may be shown to require the minimum possible paper width. Along with the algorithms proper, we discuss the reasoning behind the algorithm development."
846,Visualizing Software Systems as Cities,"This paper presents a 3D visualization approach which gravitates around the city metaphor, i.e., an object-oriented software system is represented as a city that can be traversed and interacted with: the goal is to give the viewer a sense of locality to ease program comprehension. The key point in conceiving a realistic software city is to map the information about the source code in meaningful ways in order to take the approach beyond beautiful pictures. We investigated several concepts that contribute to the urban feeling, such as appropriate layouts, topology, and facilities to ease navigation and interaction. We experimented our approach on a number of systems, and present our findings."
847,Visually localizing design problems with disharmony maps,"Assessing the quality of software design is difficult, as ""design"" is expressed through guidelines and heuristics, not rigorous rules. One successful approach to assess design quality is based on detection strategies, which are metrics-based composed logical conditions, by which design fragments with specific properties are detected in the source code. Such detection strategies, when executed on large software systems usually return large sets of artifacts, which potentially exhibit one or more ""design disharmonies"", which are then inspected manually, a cumbersome activity. In this article we present disharmony maps, a visualization-based approach to locate such flawed software artifacts in large systems. We display the whole system using a 3D visualization technique based on a city metaphor. We enrich such visualizations with the results returned by a number of detection strategies, and thus render both the static structure and the design problems that affect a subject system. We evaluate our approach on a number of open-source Java systems and report on our findings."
848,Scripting 3D Visualizations with CodeCity,"Software visualization is a useful means to present and explore large amounts of information. However, constructing useful visualizations targeted at specific tasks is often a trial-and-error process. As a consequence, a visualization prototyping tools needs to be flexible to allow for the creation of new visualizations and also to provide an environment that grants access to its powerful mechanisms. In this paper, we report on our experience with complementing the rich graphical user interface of CodeCity, a 3D visualization tool, with a scripting environment. The scripting language gives the programmers full access to the configurability of our system, without the need for them to be exposed to the real complexity of the application. Thanks to the scripting engine, adapting CodeCity to new types of data has become easy, as we illustrate with examples."
849,Empirical Validation of CodeCity: A Controlled Experiment,"We describe an empirical evaluation of a visualization approach based on a 3D city metaphor, implemented in a tool called CodeCity. We designed the controlled experiment based on a set of lessons extracted from the current body of research and perfected it during a preliminary pilot phase. We then conducted the experiment in four locations across three countries over a period of four months, involving participants from both academia and industry. We detail the decisions behind our design as well as the lessons we learned from this experience. Finally, we present the results of the experiment and the complete set of data required to ensure repeatability of the experiment."
850,Software systems as cities: A controlled experiment,"Software visualization is a popular program comprehension technique used in the context of software maintenance, reverse engineering, and software evolution analysis. While there is a broad range of software visualization approaches, only few have been empirically evaluated. This is detrimental to the acceptance of software visualization in both the academic and the industrial world. We present a controlled experiment for the empirical evaluation of a 3D software visualization approach based on a city metaphor and implemented in a tool called CodeCity. The goal is to provide experimental evidence of the viability of our approach in the context of program comprehension by having subjects perform tasks related to program comprehension. We designed our experiment based on lessons extracted from the current body of research. We conducted the experiment in four locations across three countries, involving 41 participants from both academia and industry. The experiment shows that CodeCity leads to a statistically significant increase in terms of task correctness and decrease in task completion time. We detail the experiment we performed, discuss its results and reflect on the many lessons learned."
851,Pebbles -- using Circular Treemaps to visualize disk usage,"During the 1990s Ben Shneiderman of the Human-Computer Interaction Laboritory (HCIL) of the University of Maryland invented Treemaps as a ""compact visualization of directory tree structures"". Treemaps involve ""turning a tree into a planar space-filling"" representation. Unlike other variations such as squarified treemaps, or cushion treemaps, circular treemaps as presented here could be considered an evolutionary dead-end (rejected early by Ben Shneiderman) but at least I think it's a pretty one."
852,Cushion Treemaps: Visualization of Hierarchical Information,"A new method is presented for the visualization of hierarchical information, such as directory structures and organization structures. Cushion treemaps inherit the elegance of standard treemaps: compact, space-filling displays of hierarchical information, based on recursive subdivision of a rectangular image space. Intuitive shading is used to provide insight in the hierarchical structure.During the subdivision ridges are added per rectangle, which are rendered with a simple shading model. The result is a surface that consists of recursive cushions. The method is efficient, effective, easy to use and implement, and has a wide applicability."
853,Dynamic hierarchy specification and visualization,This paper describes concepts that underlie the design and implementation of an information exploration system that allows users to impose arbitrary hierarchical organizations on their data. Such hierarchies allow a user to embed important semantic information into the hierarchy definition. Our goal is to recognize the significance of this implicit information and to utilize it in the hierarchy visualization. The innovative features of our system include the dynamic modification of the hierarchy definitions and the definition and implementation of a set of layout algorithms that utilize semantic information implicit in the tree construction.
854,Equal-Height Treemaps for multivariate data,"A well-known limitation of classic continuous treemaps is that they generally provide two (or at most a few) visual mappings for data variables apart from the hierarchical relationships. Typically, one variable maps to cell area; another maps to color. However, many data-centric tasks require human users to consider multiple variables simultaneously. The current work introduces the concept of equal-height, variable-width cells in treemaps, which affords the packing of multiple variables into the cell areas of the terminals of the hierarchy. We demonstrate how color and some largely width-invariant graphs can be utilized in the cell areas to add additional visual information in a multi-variate treemap. Examples come from machine learning and from finance applications."
855,Spatially Ordered Treemaps,"Existing treemap layout algorithms suffer to some extent from poor or inconsistent mappings between data order and visual ordering in their representation, reducing their cognitive plausibility. While attempts have been made to quantify this mismatch, and algorithms proposed to minimize inconsistency, solutions provided tend to concentrate on one-dimensional ordering. We propose extensions to the existing squarified layout algorithm that exploit the two-dimensional arrangement of treemap nodes more effectively. Our proposed spatial squarified layout algorithm provides a more consistent arrangement of nodes while maintaining low aspect ratios. It is suitable for the arrangement of data with a geographic component and can be used to create tessellated car tograms for geovisualization. Locational consistency is measured and visualized and a number of layout algorithms are compared. CIELab color space and displacement vector overlays are used to assess and emphasize the spatial layout of treemap nodes. A case study involving locations of tagged photographs in the Flickr database is described."
856,From Slice and Dice to Hierarchical Cartograms: Spatial Referencing of Treemaps,
857,An Incremental Editor for Dynamic Hierarchical Drawing of Trees,"We present an incremental tree editor based on algorithms for manipulating shape functions. The tree layout is hierarchical, left-to-right. Nodes of variable size and shape are supported. The paper presents algorithms for basic tree editing operations, including cut and paste. The layout algorithm for positioning child-subtrees rooted at a given parent is incrementally recomputed with each edit operation; it attempts to conserve the total display area allocated to child-subtrees while preserving the user’s mental map. The runtime and space efficiency is good as a result of exploiting a specially designed Shape abstraction for encoding and manipulating the geometric boundaries of subtrees as monotonic step functions to determine their best placement. All tree operations, including loading, saving trees to files, and incremental cut and paste, are worst case O(N) in time, but typically cut and paste are O(log(N)2), where N is the number of nodes."
858,The Perceptual Eye View: A User-Defined Method for Information Visualization,"With the growing volumes of data, exploring the relationships within the huge amounts of data is difficult. Information visualization uses the human perception system to assist users in analyzing complex relationships and graphical hierarchy trees used commonly to present the relationship among the data. Conventional information visualization approaches fail to consider human factors, they only provide fixed degree of detail to different users. However, different users have different perceptions. A well-known information visualization called 'Magic Eye View' uses a three-dimensional interaction to allow the user to control the degree of detail he would like. However, it fails to consider some important focus+context features such as the smooth transition of the focus region and the global context. In this paper, we propose a novel information visualization method, called the 'Perceptual Eye View,' by which users may control the focus points three-dimensionally enabling different users to view their user-defined degree of detail of information space and to perceive based on their own knowledge and perception. The results demonstrate that our proposed method improve the 'Magic Eye View' by providing smooth transition of the focus region and the global context, which are important focus+context features that the 'Magic Eye View' fails to consider."
859,TelCoVis: Visual exploration of co-occurrence in urban human mobility based on telco data,"Understanding co-occurrence in urban human mobility (i.e. people from two regions visit an urban place during the same time span) is of great value in a variety of applications, such as urban planning, business intelligence, social behavior analysis, as well as containing contagious diseases. In recent years, the widespread use of mobile phones brings an unprecedented opportunity to capture large-scale and fine-grained data to study co-occurrence in human mobility. However, due to the lack of systematic and efficient methods, it is challenging for analysts to carry out in-depth analyses and extract valuable information. In this paper, we present TelCoVis, an interactive visual analytics system, which helps analysts leverage their domain knowledge to gain insight into the co-occurrence in urban human mobility based on telco data. Our system integrates visualization techniques with new designs and combines them in a novel way to enhance analysts' perception for a comprehensive exploration. In addition, we propose to study the correlations in co-occurrence (i.e. people from multiple regions visit different places during the same time span) by means of biclustering techniques that allow analysts to better explore coordinated relationships among different regions and identify interesting patterns. The case studies based on a real-world dataset and interviews with domain experts have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system in gaining insights into co-occurrence and facilitating various analytical tasks."
860,Visualization of Distributed Processes Using Data Jewelry Box Algorithm,"Visualization of distributed processes is useful for the management of large-scale distributed computing systems. Reactivity and scalability are especially important requirements for such visualization of distributed processes. We have proposed the visualization technique ""Data Jewelry Box"" algorithm, which satisfies both of the above requirements. The technique can be applied for the visualization of distributed processes, however, the algorithm has a problem that may yield much different data layouts even among very similar datasets. This is a serious issue for the seamless visualization of time-varying data. To solve the problem, we propose the extension of ""Data Jewelry Box"" algorithm. The extension places data elements referring positions of the previous data layout, so that the extension can yield similar layouts among similar datasets. We introduce the extended algorithm, and propose the visualization system for distributed computing systems using the extended algorithm."
861,InterRing: An Interactive Tool for Visually Navigating and Manipulating Hierarchical Structures,"Radial, space-filling (RSF) techniques for hierarchy visualization have several advantages over traditional node-link diagrams, including the ability to efficiently use the display space while effectively conveying the hierarchy structure. Several RSF systems and tools have been developed to date, each with varying degrees of support for interactive operations such as selection and navigation. We describe what we believe to be a complete set of desirable operations on hierarchical structures. We then present InterRing, an RSF hierarchy visualization system that supports a significantly more extensive set of these operations than prior systems. In particular, InterRing supports multi-focus distortions, interactive hierarchy reconfiguration, and both semi-automated and manual selection. We show the power and utility of these and other operations, and describe our on-going efforts to evaluate their effectiveness and usability."
862,InterRing: A visual interface for navigating and manipulating hierarchies,"Radial, space-filling (RSF) techniques for hierarchy visualization have several advantages over traditional node–link diagrams, including the ability to use the display space efficiently while effectively conveying the hierarchy structure. Several RSF systems and tools have been developed to date, each with varying degrees of support for interactive operations such as selection and navigation. In this paper, we describe what we believe to be a complete set of desirable operations on hierarchical structures. We then present InterRing, an RSF hierarchy visualization system that supports a significantly more extensive set of these operations than prior systems. In particular, InterRing supports multifocus distortions, interactive hierarchy reconfiguration, and both semiautomated and manual selection. We show the power and utility of these and other operations, and describe our ongoing efforts to evaluate their effectiveness and usability."
863,Visualizing large hierarchies with Drawer Trees,"Enclosure partitioning approaches, such as Treemaps, have proved their effectiveness in visualizing large hierarchical structures within a compact and limited display area. Most of the Treemaps techniques do not use node-links to show the structural relations. This paper presents a new tree visualization approach known as Drawer-Tree that can be used to present the structure, organization and interrelation of big data. By utilizing the display space with traditional node-link visualization, we have developed a novel method for visualizing tree structures with high scalability. The name ""drawer"" is a metaphor that helps people understand the visualization."
864,Cabinet Tree: An orthogonal enclosure approach to visualizing and exploring big data,"Treemaps are well-known for visualizing hierarchical data. Most related approaches have been focused on layout algorithms and paid little attention to other display properties and interactions. Furthermore, the structural information in conventional Treemaps is too implicit for viewers to perceive. This paper presents Cabinet Tree, an approach that: i) draws branches explicitly to show relational structures, ii) adapts a space-optimized layout for leaves and maximizes the space utilization, iii) uses coloring and labeling strategies to clearly reveal patterns and contrast different attributes intuitively. We also apply the continuous node selection and detail window techniques to support user interaction with different levels of the hierarchies. Our quantitative evaluations demonstrate that Cabinet Tree achieves good scalability for increased resolutions and big datasets."
865,Enhanced Hexagon-Tiling Algorithm for Map-Like Information Visualisation,"Hierarchical information is ubiquitous, and analysing such information is one of the common tasks performed by its users. Map-like visualisations, which resemble geographic maps, can be a useful tool for perceiving hierarchical information. Maps have the advantage that the majority of ordinary users can easily understand them without prior training. This paper presents a novel method for visualising hierarchical data in a form resembling a geographic map, using hexagon tiling. Our method can be used for visualising general hierarchical data, such as organisational structures, library catalogues, file systems, and many more. Like treemaps, our new method is area-based, thus it not only reveals hierarchy but also other attributes. Unlike treemaps, however, our method produces visualisations that resemble geographic maps in shape and appearance. Several tactics are employed to control the space-division process and aspect ratio. In this paper we present experiments involving our visualisation, evaluations of results, comparisons with other methods, and discuss advantages and potential issues."
866,A Visualised Software Library: Nested Self-Organising Maps for Retrieving and Browsing Reusable Software Assets,"This paper presents an approach to self-structuring software libraries. The authors developed a representation scheme to construct a feature space over a collection of software assets. The feature space is represented and classified by a variety of the self-organising map, called the Nested Software Self-Organising Map (NSSOM), consisting of a top map and a set of sub-maps nested in the top map. The clustering on the top map provides general improvements in retrieval recall, while the lower-level nested maps further elaborate the clusters into more specific groups enhancing retrieval precision. The results of preliminary evaluation showed that NSSOM is capable of enhancing precision without sacrificing recall. In addition, a user-friendly browsing facility has also been developed which helps users predict the desired components by providing an intelligible search space. The present approach attempts to achieve an optimal combination of efficiency, accuracy and user-friendliness, which is not offered by the existing software retrieval systems."
867,Near optimal embedding of binary tree architecture in VLSI,"An efficient scheme is presented for embedding a complete binary tree architecture in a two-dimensional array of processing elements. The scheme utilizes almost 100% of the processing elements in the array as actual computing elements, with small and asymptotically optimal propagation delay. The maximum edge length is optimal for trees with up to six levels. The scheme is compared with other designs proposed in the literature and shown to be significantly better."
868,Computing an Optimal Layout for Cone Trees,"Many visual representations for trees have been developed in information and software visualization. One of them are cone trees, a well-known three-dimensional representation for trees. This paper is based on an approach for constructing cone trees bottom-up. For this approach, an optimal layout for these trees is given together with a proof that based on the assumptions, there can be no better layouts. This comprises special cases, an optimal constant for the general case, and a post-processing step improving the layout."
869,Elastic Hierarchies: Combining Treemaps and node-link diagrams,"We investigate the use of elastic hierarchies for representing trees, where a single graphical depiction uses a hybrid mixture, or ""interleaving"", of more basic forms at different nodes of the tree. In particular, we explore combinations of node link and treemap forms, to combine the space efficiency of treemaps with the structural clarity of node link diagrams. A taxonomy is developed to characterize the design space of such hybrid combinations. A software prototype is described, which we used to explore various techniques for visualizing, browsing and interacting with elastic hierarchies, such as side by side overview and detail views, highlighting and rubber banding across views, visualization of multiple foci, and smooth animations across transitions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the characteristics of elastic hierarchies and suggestions for research on their properties and uses."
870,Variational Circular Treemaps for interactive visualization of hierarchical data,Visualization of hierarchical data is of great importance in information visualization. We present variational circular treemaps with a novel layout algorithm by solving disk packing as a continuous optimization problem. Our variational circular treemaps achieve higher space utilization ratio compared with the traditional circular treemaps and support natural interactions as focus+context distortions and drill-down and roll-up operations for data navigation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method for visualization and interaction.
